    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="43" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="11914277&#9;miRNPs: a novel class of ribonucleoproteins containing numerous microRNAs.&#9;&#9;Gemin3 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that binds to the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein and is a component of the SMN complex, which also comprises SMN, Gemin2, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6. Reduction in SMN protein results in Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common neurodegenerative disease. The SMN complex has critical functions in the assembly/restructuring of diverse ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Here we report that Gemin3 and Gemin4 are also in a separate complex that contains eIF2C2, a member of the Argonaute protein family. This novel complex is a large approximately 15S RNP that contains numerous microRNAs (miRNAs). We describe 40 miRNAs, a few of which are identical to recently described human miRNAs, a class of small endogenous RNAs. The genomic sequences predict that miRNAs are likely to be derived from larger precursors that have the capacity to form stem-loop structures.&#9;&#9;&#9;11992206&#9;Learning, retention and generalization of a mirror tracing skill in Alzheimer's disease.&#9;&#9;The present study examined the ability of 12 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 12 age- and education-matched normal control (NC) subjects to learn and retain the visuomotor skills necessary to efficiently trace a pattern (e.g., a 4- or 6-pointed star) seen only in mirror-reversed view. Those AD (N=6) and NC (N=7) subjects who were able to initially perform the basic mirror tracing task did not differ significantly in initial level of performance, learning over trials, retention of the skill over a 30-min delay interval, and generalization of the skill to a new figure or to the opposite direction of tracing. The AD patients who were unable to initially perform the mirror tracing task were significantly worse than those who could perform the task on several neuropsychological measures sensitive to deficits in problem solving and executive functions, but not on tests of global cognitive decline, memory, language, or visuoperceptual functioning. These results indicate that acquisition and retention of a complex visuomotor skill can proceed normally in the early stages of AD in those individuals who can initially perform the basic task, and that inability to perform the basic task may be related to the frontal lobe dysfunction that is often prominent in the disorder.&#9;&#9;&#9;12082608&#9;Anoxia induces macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) in glioblastoma cells independently of p53 and HIF-1.&#9;&#9;Human astrocytic brain tumors select for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene early in malignant progression. p53 is activated upon various kinds of cellular stress leading to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, but is also implicated in complex biological processes such as inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis. In an effort to shed light on consequences mediated by p53 inactivation in gliomas, we established the Tet-On system for p53 in the LN-Z308 glioblastoma cell line. The macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) gene was identified as a most prominent p53 target gene upon gene expression profiling. Oxygen deprivation, an important cellular stress, revealed MIC-1 as an anoxia responsive gene in glioblastoma cell lines. MIC-1 up-regulation by anoxia is mediated through an alternative, p53 and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) independent pathway. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MIC-1 in LN-Z308 cell line completely abolished its inherent tumorigenicity in nude mice, while proliferation in vitro was not affected. In the present experimental model MIC-1 may exert its anti-tumorigenic properties via a paracrine mechanism mediated by host cells in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that MIC-1 is an important downstream mediator of p53 function, while acting itself as an intercessor of cellular stress signaling and exerting anti-tumorigenic activities.&#9;&#9;&#9;12325078&#9;Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome: epsilon-sarcoglycan mutations and phenotype.&#9;&#9;Mutations in the gene for epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found to cause myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. We now report clinical and genetic findings in nine additional European families with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. The clinical presentation in 24 affecteds was homogeneous with myoclonus predominantly of neck and upper limbs in 23 of them and dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp, in 13 cases. Six novel and one previously known heterozygous SGCE mutations were identified. SGCE deficiency seems to be the common pathogenetic mechanism in myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.&#9;&#9;&#9;12554860&#9;Numerous microRNPs in neuronal cells containing novel microRNAs.&#9;&#9;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common neurodegenerative disease that is caused by deletions or loss-of-function mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is part of a large complex that functions in the assembly/restructuring of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. We recently showed in HeLa cells that two components of the SMN complex, Gemin3 and Gemin4, together with the argonaute protein eIF2C2, also associate with microRNAs (miRNAs) as part of a novel class of RNPs termed miRNPs. Here we report on miRNPs isolated from neuronal cell lines of mouse and human, and describe 53 novel miRNAs. Several of these miRNAs are conserved in divergent organisms, including rat, zebrafish, pufferfish, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The chromosomal locations of most of the novel miRNAs were identified and indicate some phylogenetic conservation of the likely precursor structures. Interestingly the gene locus of one miRNA, miR-175, is a candidate region for two neurologic diseases: early-onset parkinsonism (Waisman syndrome) and X-linked mental retardation (MRX3). Also, several miRNAs identified as part of miRNPs in these cells appear to constitute two distinct subfamilies. These subfamilies comprise multiple copies of miRNAs on different chromosomes, suggesting an important function in the regulation of gene expression.&#9;&#9;&#9;12640204&#9;A cluster of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis in Jujuy, Argentina.&#9;&#9;Compared with other regions in Argentina, greater human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) seroprevalence has been reported in Jujuy Province, where it reaches 2.32% in the general population, so that a search for HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) cases deserved to be carried out. Accordingly, a clinically diagnosed and serologically confirmed cluster of cases in 1 man and 10 women, including 2 sisters, is described here. Most patients (9/11) were born in Cochinoca Department, located in an Andes highland area called Puna Jujeña, situated at more that 3400 m above sea level. No history of risk factors was disclosed, except for a single transfusion in 1 patient. In contrast to the Andean region of Bolivia, where high HTLV-I seroprevalence is in part attributable to Japanese immigrants, the Jujuy population mainly consists of aborigines, mestizos, and European descendants. Therefore, the long-term presence of virus in Jujuy natives may be taken for granted. Considering the HAM/TSP cluster described here plus previously reported isolated cases in neighboring Salta Province, we speculate that the Puna Jujeña region and regions in that vicinity would be a microepidemic focus of disease. To determine the role of possible pathogenic cofactors such as geographic, ethnic, genetic, and cultural features, further pertinent surveys are required in subtropical northwestern Argentina.&#9;&#9;&#9;12684554&#9;Functional variability of the human cortical motor map: electrical stimulation findings in perirolandic epilepsy surgery.&#9;&#9;The purpose of this study was to assess the cortical representation of sensorimotor functions in patients undergoing perirolandic epilepsy surgery, focusing on somatotopy, mosaicism, and variability of function in relation to the classic motor homunculus. The authors studied 36 patients in whom intraoperative or extraoperative electrical cortical stimulation to map motor functions was performed. A computer program was devised to register electrode number, stimulation parameters, and response to each stimulus. Electrode position was represented graphically whenever a stimulus was delivered. A total of 43 maps from 36 patients were analyzed. The authors found variations in the organization of M1 (primary motor cortex) in seven patients (19.4%). Four patients (11.1%) presented mosaicism (overlapping of functional areas), two (5.6%) presented variability (inverted disposition of M1 functional areas), and one (2.8%) had both. The results of this study challenge the notion of orderly topographic relationships between the human sensorimotor functions and their representation in the primary motor cortex. These results confirm those of other studies with animals and humans using novel imaging techniques, suggesting that the motor homunculus may not always be considered a definite and absolute representation of M1.&#9;&#9;&#9;12827450&#9;Point mutations in exon 1 of the NR4A2 gene are not a major cause of familial Parkinson's disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;12884173&#9;A possible case of myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis in an Argentinian woman with human T lymphocyte virus type II.&#9;&#9;A case of neurological disease featuring human T lymphocyte virus-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was diagnosed by serological (Western blot) and molecular (polymerase chain reaction) criteria as related to human T lymphocyte virus (HTLV)-II infection. This is, to our knowledge, the first case of this kind found in Argentina and is additional evidence that HAM/TSP solely related to HTLV-II infection occurs in HTLV-I-negative subjects.&#9;&#9;&#9;15054117&#9;Effect of short-term phytoestrogen treatment in male rats on nitric oxide-mediated responses of carotid and cerebral arteries: comparison with 17beta-estradiol.&#9;&#9;The use of estrogen for protection against vascular dysfunction is limited due to its effects on the reproductive system, particularly in males. We postulated that daidzein, an isoflavone with estrogen-like effects on the systemic vasculature but not the reproductive system, might enhance nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cerebral vasodilatation. Male rats were administered vehicle, 17beta-estradiol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), or daidzein (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) daily for 7 days. Basal and acetylcholine-stimulated NO release was assessed in vitro via carotid arterial rings or in vivo by measuring changes in basilar artery diameter. Levels of protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), caveolin-1, and calmodulin were assessed in carotid arteries using Western analysis. Plasma NO levels were doubled by daidzein or 17beta-estradiol. NO production and endothelium-dependent contraction in response to the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 100 microM) was enhanced by 50 to 100% in carotid arteries from rats treated with daidzein or 17beta-estradiol. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was selectively enhanced in carotid arteries from rats treated with daidzein. Similarly, constrictor responses of the basilar artery to L-NNA in vivo were selectively augmented by approximately 100% by 17beta-estradiol treatment and tended to be approximately 50% greater in daidzein-treated rats. Expression of caveolin-1 was decreased, and calmodulin was increased, in vessels from daidzein- or 17beta-estradiol-treated rats. eNOS expression was unaffected by the treatments. These data suggest that short-term administration of daidzein or 17beta-estradiol modulates cerebral artery reactivity in males by enhancing synthesis and release of endothelium-derived NO. Isoflavone therapy may therefore be a feasible approach to protect against cerebrovascular disease and stroke.&#9;&#9;&#9;15105437&#9;Isolation and characterization of a novel pituitary tumor apoptosis gene.&#9;&#9;To determine mechanisms for pituitary neoplasia we used methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed-PCR to isolate novel genes that are differentially methylated relative to normal pituitary. We report the isolation of a novel differentially methylated chromosome 22 CpG island-associated gene (C22orf3). Sodium bisulfite sequencing of pooled tumor cohorts, used in the isolation of this gene, showed that only a proportion of the adenomas within the pools were methylated; however, expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR of individual adenoma irrespective of subtype showed the majority (30 of 38; 79%) failed to express this gene relative to normal pituitary. Sodium bisulfite sequencing of individual adenomas showed that 6 of 30 (20%) that failed to express pituitary tumor apoptosis gene (PTAG) were methylated; however, genetic change as determined by loss of heterozygosity and sequence analysis was not apparent in the remaining tumors that failed to express this gene. In those cases where the CpG island of these genes was methylated it was invariably associated with loss of transcript expression. Enforced expression of C22orf3 in AtT20 cells had no measurable effects on cell proliferation or viability; however, in response to bromocriptine challenge (10-40 microm) cells expressing this gene showed a significantly augmented apoptotic response as determined by both acridine orange staining and TUNEL labeling. The apoptotic response to bromocriptine challenge was inhibited in coincubation experiments with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. In addition, in time course experiments, direct measurement of active caspases by fluorochrome-labeled inhibition of caspases, showed an augmented increase (approximately 2.4 fold) in active caspases in response to bromocriptine challenge in cells expressing C22orf3 relative to those harboring an empty vector control. The pituitary tumor derivation and its role in apoptosis of this gene led us to assign the acronym PTAG to this gene and its protein product. The ability of cells, showing reduced expression of PTAG, to evade or show a blunted apoptotic response may underlie oncogenic transformation in both the pituitary and other tumor types.&#9;&#9;&#9;15509239&#9;Survival analysis of the surgical outcome of temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis.&#9;&#9;PURPOSE: Surgical results in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS) are often reported in conjunction with other etiologies of TLE.&#9;METHODS: We prospectively collected surgical outcome data for 2 to 11 years for 134 consecutive patients who specifically had MTLE and unilateral HS, according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirmed by histopathology. Sixty-five had postoperative neuropsychological testing. Outcome was analyzed by using Engel's classification (a) through Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves (as a function of the time to seizure recurrence), (b) as percentage of patients in each outcome class on a yearly basis, and (c) at the last updated follow-up.&#9;RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimates of complete seizure freedom (Engel's class IA) for years 1, 2, 5, and 10 were 85%, 77%, 74%, and 66%, and of Engel's class I were 89%, 86%, 83%, and 81%. Only nine (6.7%) patients had outcome classes III or IV at any point during follow-up. Of the patients tested, 26% of those operated on the left side and 22% of those operated on the right had postoperative decline of &gt;1 SD in verbal or visual memory, respectively.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: High rates of seizure freedom can be obtained and remain stable over the years in patients operated on for unilateral MTLE/HS, even in countries with limited resources.&#9;&#9;&#9;15756081&#9;Adverse events and death in stroke patients admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary university hospital.&#9;&#9;OBJECTIVES: To identify the occurrence of adverse events in stroke patients presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary university facility, and to disclose the categories of adverse events associated with death.&#9;METHODS: This matched case-control study enrolled 468 patients admitted with stroke to the emergency department from March 1996 to September 1999. The cases comprised 234 consecutive deaths and the controls 234 discharged patients, matched for primary diagnosis and admission period. Adverse events, detected by chart review, were classified according to the degree of severity, immediate causes, and professional category. The association with death was analysed by conditional logistic regression.&#9;RESULTS: Adverse events totaled 1218 and occurred in 295 patients: 932 events (76.5%) in 170 cases and 286 (23.5%) in 125 controls. Major adverse events equaled 54.1% of all events (659 episodes): 538 events in 143 cases and 121 in 65 controls. Diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and nursing activities accounted for 55.2% of events. Nursing (38.4%) and medical (31%) adverse events represented the most common related professional categories. A significant association with death was found for major adverse events, medical adverse events, and nosocomial infections, with adjusted odds ratio estimates of 3.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64-8.54], 3.71 (95% CI 1.61-8.53), and 3.22 (95% CI 1.21-8.59), respectively.&#9;CONCLUSION: Adverse events, mostly severe, predominated among deceased patients, resulting mainly from diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and nursing activities. In spite of limitations concerning the observational retrospective nature of this study, we found that severe adverse events, medical adverse events, and nosocomial infections were significantly associated with death in stroke patients.&#9;&#9;&#9;15782179&#9;Microarray-based, high-throughput gene expression profiling of microRNAs.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that serve fundamental biological roles across eukaryotic species. We describe a new method for high-throughput miRNA detection. The technique is termed the RNA-primed, array-based Klenow enzyme (RAKE) assay, because it involves on-slide application of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to extend unmodified miRNAs hybridized to immobilized DNA probes. We used RAKE to study human cell lines and brain tumors. We show that the RAKE assay is sensitive and specific for miRNAs and is ideally suited for rapid expression profiling of all known miRNAs. RAKE offers unique advantages for specificity over northern blots or other microarray-based expression profiling platforms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miRNAs can be isolated and profiled from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which opens up new opportunities for analyses of small RNAs from archival human tissue. The RAKE assay is theoretically versatile and may be used for other applications, such as viral gene profiling.&#9;&#9;&#9;15883265&#9;Earlier onset of Alzheimer disease symptoms in latino individuals compared with anglo individuals.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Latino individuals are the largest minority group and the fastest growing population group in the United States, yet there are few studies comparing the clinical features of Alzheimer disease (AD) in this population with those found in Anglo (white non-Latino) patients.&#9;OBJECTIVE: To compare the age at AD symptom onset in Latino and Anglo individuals.&#9;DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment using standardized methods to collect and compare age at AD symptom onset, demographic variables, and medical variables.&#9;SETTING: Five National Institute on Aging-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Centers with experience evaluating Spanish-speaking individuals.&#9;PATIENTS: We evaluated 119 Latino and 55 Anglo patients who had a diagnosis of AD.&#9;MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Age at symptom onset.&#9;RESULTS: After adjusting for center, sex, and years of education, Latino patients had a mean age at symptom onset 6.8 years earlier (95% confidence interval, 3.5-10.3 years earlier) than Anglo patients.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: An earlier age at symptom onset suggests that US mainland Latino individuals may experience an increased burden of AD compared with Anglo individuals. The basis for the younger age at symptom onset remains obscure.&#9;&#9;&#9;16009764&#9;Spectrum of mutations in biopsy-proven CADASIL: implications for diagnostic strategies.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene are the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which is an important cause of stroke in young adults. Mutations are typically located within epidermal growth factor-like repeat domains in the extracellular part of the Notch3 receptor. Identification of the mutation is critical for genetic counseling and testing of relatives at risk.&#9;OBJECTIVES: To identify the spectrum of NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL and to discuss the implications for diagnostic strategies.&#9;DESIGN: Screening for NOTCH3 mutations was performed in 125 unrelated German CADASIL patients with biopsy-proven disease by direct sequencing of exons coding for epidermal growth factor-like repeats. Results were compared with those of previously published studies.&#9;RESULTS: We detected 54 distinct mutations (117 missense mutations and 3 in-frame deletions) in 120 (96.0%) of the 125 patients. Of the mutations, 58.3% were located in exon 4 and 85.8% in exons 2 through 6. In 5 patients (4.0%), no mutation was identified.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Almost 90% of mutations could be detected within a few exons (exons 2-6). Thus, genetic testing should initially be focused on these exons, with some variation depending on the population in whom it is being performed. Yet, genetic testing for CADASIL is associated with a nameable proportion of false-negative results. Cases with a high index of clinical suspicion should be investigated by skin biopsy if genetic testing is negative.&#9;&#9;&#9;16024602&#9;MicroRNA-21 is an antiapoptotic factor in human glioblastoma cells.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by targeting the mRNA of protein-coding genes for either cleavage or repression of translation. The roles of miRNAs in lineage determination and proliferation as well as the location of several miRNA genes at sites of translocation breakpoints or deletions has led to the speculation that miRNAs could be important factors in the development or maintenance of the neoplastic state. Here we show that the highly malignant human brain tumor, glioblastoma, strongly over-expresses a specific miRNA, miR-21. Our studies show markedly elevated miR-21 levels in human glioblastoma tumor tissues, early-passage glioblastoma cultures, and in six established glioblastoma cell lines (A172, U87, U373, LN229, LN428, and LN308) compared with nonneoplastic fetal and adult brain tissues and compared with cultured nonneoplastic glial cells. Knockdown of miR-21 in cultured glioblastoma cells triggers activation of caspases and leads to increased apoptotic cell death. Our data suggest that aberrantly expressed miR-21 may contribute to the malignant phenotype by blocking expression of critical apoptosis-related genes.&#9;&#9;&#9;16039986&#9;Extensive modulation of a set of microRNAs in primary glioblastoma.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules playing regulatory roles in animals and plants by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts. The specific modulation of several microRNAs has been recently associated to some forms of human cancer, suggesting that these short molecules may represent a new class of genes involved in oncogenesis. In our study, we examined by microarray the global expression levels of 245 microRNAs in glioblastoma multiforme, the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors. The analysis of both glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines allowed us to identify a group of microRNAs whose expression is significantly altered in this tumor. The most interesting results came from miR-221, strongly up-regulated in glioblastoma and from a set of brain-enriched miRNAs, miR-128, miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181c, which are down-regulated in glioblastoma.&#9;&#9;&#9;16325011&#9;Design of shRNAs for RNAi-A lesson from pre-miRNA processing: possible clinical applications.&#9;&#9;RNA interference has become the tool of choice to analyse the loss-of-function of individual genes and has been exploited to identify complex regulatory pathways following genomic screening. RNAi has both admirers and detractors, but is undeniably a technique with great potential, which has come a long way in the short time since its discovery. RNAi utilises cellular machinery associated with the processing of naturally occurring micro RNA (miRNAs). Effective use of RNAi requires detailed knowledge of the individual steps and the proteins involved, as well as the similarities and distinctions between miRNA and siRNA pathways. RNAi was originally induced by the introduction of long double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into cells in which the RNA was cleaved into short RNAs which effectively interfered with a transcription of cognate mRNA. More recently an introduction of short approximately 22 nucleotide RNA duplexes has become the standard in short-term experiments, but is insufficient for long-term knock-down assays. Long-term expression of siRNAs has been achieved by in vivo transcription from plasmids coding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The cellular processing of shRNAs shares common features with the biogenesis of naturally occurring miRNA such as cleavage by nuclear RNase Drosha, export from the nucleus, processing by a cytoplasmic RNase Dicer, and incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Each step has a crucial influence on the efficiency of RNAi and their consideration should be a part of a standard experimental design. RNAi has moved from a purely experimental technique to the stage of potential clinical applications. The possible use of RNAi in the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with its advantages and pitfalls and possible extensions to other diseases are discussed.&#9;&#9;&#9;16373485&#9;RAKE and LNA-ISH reveal microRNA expression and localization in archival human brain.&#9;&#9;microRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 22 nucleotide) regulatory RNAs which play fundamental roles in many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that the expression of many miRNAs is altered in various human tumors and some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. However, with the exception of glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of miRNAs in brain tumors is unknown. Furthermore, methods to profile miRNAs from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissues or to study their cellular and subcellular localization in FFPE tissues have been lacking. Here we report the coordinated miRNA expression analysis from the tissue level to the subcellular level, using the RAKE (RNA-primed, array-based, Klenow Enzyme) miRNA microarray platform in conjunction with Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-based in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH) on archival FFPE human brains and oligodendroglial tumors. The ability to profile miRNAs from archival tissues at the tissue level, by RAKE microarrays, and at the cellular level by LNA-ISH, will accelerate studies of miRNAs in human diseases.&#9;&#9;&#9;16509149&#9;Seizure and memory outcome following temporal lobe surgery: selective compared with nonselective approaches for hippocampal sclerosis.&#9;&#9;OBJECT: The aim of this study was to compare seizure and memory outcome in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS) treated using an anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or a selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SA).&#9;METHODS: Surgical outcome data were prospectively collected for 2 to 11 years in 161 consecutive patients with MTLE/ HS. Eighty patients underwent an ATL and 81 an SA. Seizure control achieved with each technique was compared using the Engel classification scheme. Postoperative memory testing was performed in 86 patients (53%). At the last follow up, 72% of the patients who had undergone an ATL (mean follow up 6.7 years) and 71% of those who had undergone an SA (mean follow up 4.5 years) were seizure free (Engle Class IA). Estimated survival in patients in Engel Classes I, IA, and I and II combined did not differ between the two surgical techniques. Preoperatively, 58% of the patients had verbal memory scores one standard deviation (SD) below the normal mean. One third of the patients with preoperative scores in the normal range worsened after surgery, although this outcome was not related to the surgical technique. In contrast, one third of those whose preoperative scores were less than -1 SD experienced improvement after surgery. Nine (18%) of the 50 patients whose left side had been surgically treated improved their verbal memory scores by more than one SD. Seven (78%) of these nine underwent an SA (p = 0.05).&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Both ATL and SA can lead to similar favorable seizure control in patients with MTLE/HS. Preliminary data suggest that postoperative verbal memory scores may improve in patients who undergo selective resection of a sclerotic hippocampus in the dominant temporal lobe.&#9;&#9;&#9;16917625&#9;[Spatial orientation memory: evaluation in patents with Alzheimer disease and temporal lobe epilepsy].&#9;&#9;Experimental studies have identified pyramidal cells in hippocampus in rats with participation in the spatial orientation memory (SOM), which are named location cells. This study had the purpose to adapt a test based in these experiments in order to check the performance of SOM and the participation of hippocampus into SOM in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). The research was divided into two studies: the first one the test was adapted, and in order to check its capacity to investigate the deficits of SOM, it has applied in groups of 10 (ten) subjects, one group with patients that have Alzheimer disease and the other one with healthy elderly (p&lt;0.001). The second study has evaluated the participation of hippocampus into SOM in 43 patients (23 with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and 20 submitted to selective amygdala hippocampectomy (SAH)) and 23 healthy volunteers with p&lt;0,05 between MTS and SAH and between controlled and SAH. It was shown that the test of SOM is suitable to evaluate deficits, but it seems the SOM is not a specific function of human hippocampus.&#9;&#9;&#9;17018300&#9;MicroRNA pathways modulate polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration.&#9;&#9;Nine human neurodegenerative diseases are due to expansion of a CAG repeat- encoding glutamine within the open reading frame of the respective genes. Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion confers dominant toxicity, resulting in neuronal degeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to modulate programmed cell death during development. To address whether miRNA pathways play a role in neurodegeneration, we tested whether genes critical for miRNA processing modulated toxicity induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein. These studies revealed a striking enhancement of polyQ toxicity upon reduction of miRNA processing in Drosophila and human cells. In parallel genetic screens, we identified the miRNA bantam (ban) as a potent modulator of both polyQ and tau toxicity in flies. Our studies suggest that ban functions downstream of toxicity of the SCA3 protein, to prevent degeneration. These findings indicate that miRNA pathways dramatically modulate polyQ- and tau-induced neurodegeneration, providing the foundation for new insight into therapeutics.&#9;&#9;&#9;17111382&#9;Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs by microarray: a possible role for microRNA genes in pituitary adenomas.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by targeting mRNA. It has been demonstrated that miRNA expression is altered in many human cancers, suggesting that they may play a role in human neoplasia. To determine whether miRNA expression is altered in pituitary adenomas, we analyzed the entire miRNAome in 32 pituitary adenomas and in 6 normal pituitary samples by microarray and by Real-Time PCR. Here, we show that 30 miRNAs are differentially expressed between normal pituitary and pituitary adenomas. Moreover, 24 miRNAs were identified as a predictive signature of pituitary adenoma and 29 miRNAs were able to predict pituitary adenoma histotype. miRNA expression could differentiate micro- from macro-adenomas and treated from non-treated patient samples. Several of the identified miRNAs are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting that their deregulated expression may be involved in pituitary tumorigenesis. Predictive miRNAs could be potentially useful diagnostic markers, improving the classification of pituitary adenomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;17172864&#9;A new role for microRNA pathways: modulation of degeneration induced by pathogenic human disease proteins.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target transcript mRNAs. Many miRNAs have been defined, however their roles and the processes influenced by miRNA pathways are still being elucidated. A role for miRNAs in development and cancer has been described. We recently isolated the miRNA bantam (ban) in a genetic screen for modulators of pathogenicity of a human neurodegenerative disease model in Drosophila. These studies showed that upregulation of ban mitigates degeneration induced by the pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) protein Ataxin-3, which is mutated in the human polyglutamine disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). To address the broader role for miRNAs in neuroprotection, we also showed that loss of all miRNAs, by dicer mutation, dramatically enhances pathogenic polyQ protein toxicity in flies and in human HeLa cells. These studies suggest that miRNAs may be important for neuronal survival in the context of human neurodegenerative disease. These studies provide the foundation to define the miRNAs involved in neurodegenerative disease, and the biological pathways affected.&#9;&#9;&#9;17326821&#9;microRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that are now thought to regulate the expression of many mRNAs. They have been implicated in the etiology of a variety of complex diseases, including Tourette's syndrome, Fragile x syndrome, and several types of cancer.&#9;RESULTS: We hypothesized that schizophrenia might be associated with altered miRNA profiles. To investigate this possibility we compared the expression of 264 human miRNAs from postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 13) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) to tissue of 21 psychiatrically unaffected individuals using a custom miRNA microarray. Allowing a 5% false discovery rate, we found that 16 miRNAs were differentially expressed in prefrontal cortex of patient subjects, with 15 expressed at lower levels (fold change 0.63 to 0.89) and 1 at a higher level (fold change 1.77) than in the psychiatrically unaffected comparison subjects. The expression levels of 12 selected miRNAs were also determined by quantitative RT-PCR in our lab. For the eight miRNAs distinguished by being expressed at lower microarray levels in schizophrenia samples versus comparison samples, seven were also expressed at lower levels with quantitative RT-PCR.&#9;CONCLUSION: This study is the first to find altered miRNA profiles in postmortem prefrontal cortex from schizophrenia patients.&#9;&#9;&#9;17347136&#9;Role of epigenetic effectors in maintenance of the long-term persistent bystander effect in spleen in vivo.&#9;&#9;Radiation therapy is a primary treatment modality for brain tumors, yet it has been linked to the increased incidence of secondary, post-radiation therapy cancers. These cancers are thought to be linked to indirect radiation-induced bystander effect. Bystander effect occurs when irradiated cells communicate damage to nearby, non-irradiated 'bystander' cells, ultimately contributing to genome destabilization in the non-exposed cells. Recent evidence suggests that bystander effect may be epigenetic in nature; however, characterization of epigenetic mechanisms involved in bystander effect generation and its long-term persistence has yet to be defined. To investigate the possibility that localized X-ray irradiation induces persistent bystander effects in distant tissue, we monitored the induction of epigenetic changes (i.e. alterations in DNA methylation, histone methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression) in the rat spleen tissue 24 h and 7 months after localized cranial exposure to 20 Gy of X-rays. We found that localized cranial radiation exposure led to the induction of bystander effect in lead-shielded, distant spleen tissue. Specifically, this exposure caused the profound epigenetic dysregulation in the bystander spleen tissue that manifested as a significant loss of global DNA methylation, alterations in methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposable elements and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-binding protein methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Further, irradiation significantly altered expression of miR-194, a miRNA putatively targeting both DNA methyltransferase-3a and MeCP2. This study is the first to report conclusive evidence of the long-term persistence of bystander effects in radiation carcinogenesis target organ (spleen) upon localized distant exposure using the doses comparable with those used for clinical brain tumor treatments.&#9;&#9;&#9;17478730&#9;MicroRNA expression signature and antisense-mediated depletion reveal an essential role of MicroRNA in vascular neointimal lesion formation.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate about 30% of the encoding genes of the human genome. However, the role of miRNAs in vascular disease is currently completely unknown. Using microarray analysis, we demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the vascular walls after balloon injury. The aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Modulating an aberrantly overexpressed miRNA, miR-21, via antisense-mediated depletion (knock-down) had a significant negative effect on neointimal lesion formation. In vitro, the expression level of miR-21 in dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells was significantly higher than that in fresh isolated differentiated cells. Depletion of miR-21 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. MiR-21-mediated cellular effects were further confirmed in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PTEN and Bcl-2 were involved in miR-21-mediated cellular effects. The results suggest that miRNAs are novel regulatory RNAs for neointimal lesion formation. MiRNAs may be a new therapeutic target for proliferative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, postangioplasty restenosis, transplantation arteriopathy, and stroke.&#9;&#9;&#9;17504026&#9;MicroRNA and brain tumors: a cause and a cure?&#9;&#9;Malignant brain tumors, including high-grade gliomas, are among the most lethal of all cancers. Despite considerable advances, including multi-modal treatments with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the overall prognosis remains dismal for patients diagnosed with these tumors. With the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) for target-specific gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA), a novel method to target malignant gliomas has been exposed, an endeavor that is aggressively being carried out in numerous laboratories. However, practical difficulties in tissue- or organ-specific targeting of therapeutic quantities of siRNA still preclude its applicability in a clinical setting. MicroRNA (miRNA), an endogenously expressed form of siRNA, not only presents an alternate method to induce RNAi in a given diseased tissue or organ, but also exposes a unique set of diagnostic markers that can be used to identify, and then differentiate between tumor grades. Thus, miRNA can be considered the cells' answer to siRNA. Discovered over a decade ago, miRNA is fast becoming recognized as crucial in regulating gene expression in cancers. Therein lies the therapeutic potential of miRNA, as it may now be possible to induce or inhibit RNAi in a given diseased cell population by controlling the cells' miRNA expression profile. This review outlines the potential of miRNA as a therapeutic strategy against high-grade gliomas, and also the technological hurdles that need to be addressed before this promising technique can be administered in a clinical setting.&#9;&#9;&#9;17542255&#9;[Irregular secretion of prolactin in infertile women with normoprolactinemic galactorrhea].&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Abnormal frequency and pulse amplitud of prolactin secretion in micro and macroprolactinomas has been atributed to a dysfunctional tumoral lactotrope. Previous evidence suggests that non tumoral hyperprolactinemia is caused by a hypothalamic dysfunction. The regularity of prolactin secretion has not been studied with cuantitative methods in patients with normoprolactinemic galactorrhea (NPG) which could be considered an entity that precedes non tumoral and tumoral hyperprolactinemia. Objective: To analyze the 24-hour prolactin secretion pattern and its secretion regularity in a group of infertile women with normoprolactinemic galatorea.&#9;PATIENTS AND METHODS: A transversal-comparative study was carried out in 6 infertile women with normoprolactinemic galactorrhea and 4 healthy women as controls. The 24 hour prolactin profile, the ratio night time mean concentration/daytime mean concentrattion (NM/DM ratio) and apparent entropy (Ap En, Ap En ratio) were compared in the two groups.&#9;RESULTS: Blunting of the nyctohemeral rythm and nocturn hyperprolactinaemia occurred in patients with normoprolactinemic galactorrhea (NPG). NM/DM ratio was lower in patients with NPG than in controls (1.28 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.75 +/- 0.05; p= 0.01). Higher irregularity of prolactin secretion was found in patients with NPG (ApEn: 0.853 +/- 0.158 vs 0.608 +/- 0.171, p=0.04; Ap En ratio: 0.839 +/- 0.11 vs 0.661 +/- 0.14; p=0.04).&#9;CONCLUSIONS: The irregularity of prolactin secretion in patients with NPG is not dependant on the presence of a pituitary tumour which suggests that a hypothalamic dysfunction underlies this condition. An irregular secretion and a higher daily mass production of prolactin in patients with NPG could explain both galactorrhea and infertility.&#9;&#9;&#9;17629564&#9;Induction of specific micro RNA (miRNA) species by ROS-generating metal sulfates in primary human brain cells.&#9;&#9;Iron- and aluminum-sulfate together, at nanomolar concentrations, trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultures of human brain cells. Previous studies have shown that following ROS induction, a family of pathogenic brain genes that promote inflammatory signalling, cellular apoptosis and brain cell death is significantly over-expressed. Notably, iron- and aluminum-sulfate induce genes in cultured human brain cells that exhibit expression patterns similar to those observed to be up-regulated in moderate- to late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we have extended our investigations to analyze the expression of micro RNA (miRNA) populations in iron- and aluminum-sulfate treated human neural cells in primary culture. The main finding was that these ROS-generating neurotoxic metal sulfates also up-regulate a specific set of miRNAs that includes miR-9, miR-125b and miR-128. Notably, these same miRNAs are up-regulated in AD brain. These findings further support the idea that iron- and aluminum-sulfates induce genotoxicity via a ROS-mediated up-regulation of specific regulatory elements and pathogenic genes that redirect brain cell fate towards progressive dysfunction and apoptotic cell death.&#9;&#9;&#9;17716659&#9;Lentiviral RNAi-induced downregulation of adenosine kinase in human mesenchymal stem cell grafts: a novel perspective for seizure control.&#9;&#9;Cell therapies based on focal delivery of the inhibitory neuromodulator adenosine were previously shown to provide potent seizure suppression in animal models of epilepsy. However, hitherto used therapeutic cells were derived from rodents and thus not suitable for clinical applications. Autologous patient-derived adenosine-releasing cell implants would constitute a major therapeutic advance to avoid both xenotransplantation and immunosuppression. Here we describe a novel approach based on lentiviral RNAi mediated downregulation of adenosine kinase (ADK), the major adenosine-removing enzyme, in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which would be compatible with autologous cell grafting in patients. Following lentiviral transduction of hMSCs with anti-ADK miRNA expression cassettes we demonstrate up to 80% downregulation of ADK and a concentration of 8.5 ng adenosine per ml of medium after incubating 10(5) cells for 8 h. hMSCs with a knockdown of ADK or cells expressing a scrambled control sequence were transplanted into hippocampi of mice 1 week prior to the intraamygdaloid injection of kainic acid (KA). While mice with control implants expressing a scrambled miRNA sequence or sham treated control animals were characterized by KA-induced status epilepticus and subsequent CA3 neuronal cell loss, animals with therapeutic ADK knockdown implants displayed a 35% reduction in seizure duration and 65% reduction in CA3 neuronal cell loss, when analyzed 24 h after KA-injection. We conclude that lentiviral expression of anti-ADK miRNA constitutes a versatile tool to generate therapeutically effective adenosine releasing hMSCs, thus representing a model system to generate patient identical autologous adult stem cell grafts.&#9;&#9;&#9;17726534&#9;Detection of a microRNA signal in an in vivo expression set of mRNAs.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nucleotide non-coding transcripts capable of regulating gene expression. The most widely studied mechanism of regulation involves binding of a miRNA to the target mRNA. As a result, translation of the target mRNA is inhibited and the mRNA may be destabilized. The inhibitory effects of miRNAs have been linked to diverse cellular processes including malignant proliferation, apoptosis, development, differentiation, and metabolic processes. We asked whether endogenous fluctuations in a set of mRNA and miRNA profiles contain correlated changes that are statistically distinguishable from the many other fluctuations in the data set.&#9;METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RNA was extracted from 12 human primary brain tumor biopsies. These samples were used to determine genome-wide mRNA expression levels by microarray analysis and a miRNA profile by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Correlation coefficients were determined for all possible mRNA-miRNA pairs and the distribution of these correlations compared to the random distribution. An excess of high positive and negative correlation pairs were observed at the tails of these distributions. Most of these highest correlation pairs do not contain sufficiently complementary sequences to predict a target relationship; nor do they lie in physical proximity to each other. However, by examining pairs in which the significance of the correlation coefficients is modestly relaxed, negative correlations do tend to predict targets and positive correlations tend to predict physically proximate pairs. A subset of high correlation pairs were experimentally validated by over-expressing or suppressing a miRNA and measuring the correlated mRNAs.&#9;CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Sufficient information exists within a set of tumor samples to detect endogenous correlations between miRNA and mRNA levels. Based on the validations the causal arrow for these correlations is likely to be directed from the miRNAs to the mRNAs. From these data sets, we inferred and validated a tumor suppression pathway linked to miR-181c.&#9;&#9;&#9;17761882&#9;A MicroRNA feedback circuit in midbrain dopamine neurons.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, 18- to 25-nucleotide, non-protein coding transcripts that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression during development. miRNAs also occur in postmitotic cells, such as neurons in the mammalian central nervous system, but their function is less well characterized. We investigated the role of miRNAs in mammalian midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DNs). We identified a miRNA, miR-133b, that is specifically expressed in midbrain DNs and is deficient in midbrain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease. miR-133b regulates the maturation and function of midbrain DNs within a negative feedback circuit that includes the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3. We propose a role for this feedback circuit in the fine-tuning of dopaminergic behaviors such as locomotion.&#9;&#9;&#9;17897455&#9;pHUSH: a single vector system for conditional gene expression.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Conditional expression vectors have become a valuable research tool to avoid artefacts that may result from traditional gene expression studies. However, most systems require multiple plasmids that must be independently engineered into the target system, resulting in experimental delay and an increased potential for selection of a cell subpopulation that differs significantly from the parental line. We have therefore developed pHUSH, an inducible expression system that allows regulated expression of shRNA, miRNA or cDNA cassettes on a single viral vector.&#9;RESULTS: Both Pol II and Pol III promoters have been successfully combined with a second expression cassette containing a codon-optimized tetracycline repressor and selectable marker. We provide examples of how pHUSH has been successfully employed to study the function of target genes in a number of cell types within in vitro and in vivo assays, including conditional gene knockdown in a murine model of brain cancer.&#9;CONCLUSION: We have successfully developed and employed a single vector system that enables Doxycycline regulated RNAi or transgene expression in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. These studies demonstrate the broad application potential of pHUSH for conditional genetic engineering in mammalian cells.&#9;&#9;&#9;17989771&#9;Orthologous microRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions in human and mouse.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate differentiation and development in many organisms and play an important role in cancer.&#9;METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a public database of mapped retroviral insertion sites from various mouse models of cancer we demonstrate that MLV-derived retroviral inserts are enriched in close proximity to mouse miRNA loci. Clustered inserts from cancer-associated regions (Common Integration Sites, CIS) have a higher association with miRNAs than non-clustered inserts. Ten CIS-associated miRNA loci containing 22 miRNAs are located within 10 kb of known CIS insertions. Only one CIS-associated miRNA locus overlaps a RefSeq protein-coding gene and six loci are located more than 10 kb from any RefSeq gene. CIS-associated miRNAs on average are more conserved in vertebrates than miRNAs associated with non-CIS inserts and their human homologs are also located in regions perturbed in cancer. In addition we show that miRNA genes are enriched around promoter and/or terminator regions of RefSeq genes in both mouse and human.&#9;CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide a list of ten miRNA loci potentially involved in the development of blood cancer or brain tumors. There is independent experimental support from other studies for the involvement of miRNAs from at least three CIS-associated miRNA loci in cancer development.&#9;&#9;&#9;18175567&#9;[A study on miRNA alternation after H2O2-induced PC12 cell apoptosis using microarray technique].&#9;&#9;OBJECTIVE: To screen the differentially expressed microRNAs(miRNA) between H2O2-induced PC12 cell apoptosis and normal PC12 cells with microarray chips.&#9;METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 12 hours, and then the cell viabilities were evaluated by MTT assay and cell apoptosis rates were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). miRNAs were isolated from control (0 nmol/L H2O2) and H2O2 treated (at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 400 nmol/L H2O2, respectively) groups of the PC12 cells, respectively, and were then detected and analyzed by microarray chips.&#9;RESULTS: The P12 cell viabilities in control and H2O2 treated group were (92 +/- 9.8)%, (90 +/- 14.70)%, (80 +/- 13.85)%, (54 +/- 12.23)%, and (22 +/- 7.35)%, respectively. The apoptosis rates for them were 2.6%, 5.2%, 7.2%, 10.4%, 16.6%, and 72.2% accordingly. Expression of 68 miRNAs and 46 miRNAs were detected in both control group and the H2O2 treated groups. Of the 46 miRNAs in the H2O2 treated groups, 39 were similar to that of the control group and 6 were significantly down-regulated.&#9;CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data may provide a new potential foundation for further study of pathogenesis and its treatment of nerve cell apoptosis caused by cerebral ischemia reperfusion.&#9;&#9;&#9;18226107&#9;MicroRNA involvement in brain tumors: from bench to bedside.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs, are effective post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, exhibiting, when altered in human tumors, both oncogenic and tumor suppressive potential. Recently, miRNA involvement in the pathophysiology of brain cancer has been assessed. Aberrant gene expression is the main mechanism of miRNAs dysfunction in cancer, with abnormal expression levels of mature and/or precursor miRNA expression in tumor samples versus normal. MiRNA germline and somatic mutations or polymorphisms in the protein coding messenger RNA targeted by miRNAs may also occur, contributing to cancer predisposition, initiation and/or progression. If present in somatic cells, miRNA alterations may play a role in tumor initiation, while if present in germ line cells they could constitute a cancer predisposing event. MiRNA expression profiling of human tumors has led to the identification of signatures correlated with the tumor diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to treatment. MiRNA fingerprinting can therefore be added to the diagnostic and prognostic tools used by medical oncologists. Furthermore, new therapeutic strategies involving miRNA silencing or miRNA mimics could be proposed based on the roles of these small non-coding RNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in brain tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;18226108&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in neurodegenerative diseases.&#9;&#9;Aging-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are the culmination of many different genetic and environmental influences. Prior studies have shown that RNAs are pathologically altered during the inexorable course of some NDs. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be a contributing factor in neurodegeneration. miRNAs are brain-enriched, small ( approximately 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that participate in mRNA translational regulation. Although discovered in the framework of worm development, miRNAs are now appreciated to play a dynamic role in many mammalian brain-related biochemical pathways, including neuroplasticity and stress responses. Research about miRNAs in the context of neurodegeneration is accumulating rapidly, and the goal of this review is to provide perspective for these new data that may be helpful to specialists in either field. An overview is provided about the normal functions for miRNAs, including some of the newer concepts related to the human brain. Recently published studies pertaining to the roles of miRNAs in NDs--including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and triplet repeat disorders-are described. Finally, a discussion is included with theoretical syntheses and possible future directions in exploring the nexus between miRNA and ND research.&#9;&#9;&#9;18234899&#9;The expression of microRNA miR-107 decreases early in Alzheimer's disease and may accelerate disease progression through regulation of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that participate in posttranscriptional gene regulation in a sequence-specific manner. However, little is understood about the role(s) of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from human brain tissue from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center Brain Bank with near-optimal clinicopathological correlation. Cases were separated into four groups: elderly nondemented with negligible AD-type pathology, nondemented with incipient AD pathology, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with moderate AD pathology, and AD. Among the AD-related miRNA expression changes, miR-107 was exceptional because miR-107 levels decreased significantly even in patients with the earliest stages of pathology. In situ hybridization with cross-comparison to neuropathology demonstrated that particular cerebral cortical laminas involved by AD pathology exhibit diminished neuronal miR-107 expression. Computational analysis predicted that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA is targeted multiply by miR-107. From the same RNA material analyzed on miRNA microarrays, mRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Exon Array microarrays on nondemented, MCI, and AD patients. BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD. Cell culture reporter assays performed with a subset of the predicted miR-107 binding sites indicate the presence of at least one physiological miR-107 miRNA recognition sequence in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA. Together, the coordinated application of miRNA profiling, Affymetrix microarrays, new bioinformatics predictions, in situ hybridization, and biochemical validation indicate that miR-107 may be involved in accelerated disease progression through regulation of BACE1.&#9;&#9;&#9;18258830&#9;MicroRNA expression in the blood and brain of rats subjected to transient focal ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several hundred small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified and characterized from various organisms, including humans. In humans, some of these miRNAs have been found to regulate (patho)physiologic conditions such as tumor progression/regression, cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, etc. In this report, we present data on the miRNAs expressed under ischemic conditions in both the brain and blood of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).&#9;METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to MCAo were reperfused for either 24 or 48 hours, and both blood and brain samples were harvested. miRNA expression profiling and oligonucleotide microarray were carried out, and the data were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with published data on protein and gene expression in MCAo rats.&#9;RESULTS: We report here for the first time the involvement of miRNA regulation in brain pathogenesis associated with MCAo. Comparison with the corresponding DNA microarray data revealed that the target mRNA expression is correlated with the regulation of miRNA. We have also provided evidence that some of the miRNAs that are highly expressed in the ischemic brain can be detected in blood samples.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in stroke and related pathologies.&#9;&#9;&#9;18319074&#9;ADCK3, an ancestral kinase, is mutated in a form of recessive ataxia associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency.&#9;&#9;Muscle coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10) or ubiquinone) deficiency has been identified in more than 20 patients with presumed autosomal-recessive ataxia. However, mutations in genes required for CoQ(10) biosynthetic pathway have been identified only in patients with infantile-onset multisystemic diseases or isolated nephropathy. Our SNP-based genome-wide scan in a large consanguineous family revealed a locus for autosomal-recessive ataxia at chromosome 1q41. The causative mutation is a homozygous splice-site mutation in the aarF-domain-containing kinase 3 gene (ADCK3). Five additional mutations in ADCK3 were found in three patients with sporadic ataxia, including one known to have CoQ(10) deficiency in muscle. All of the patients have childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia with slow progression, and three of six have mildly elevated lactate levels. ADCK3 is a mitochondrial protein homologous to the yeast COQ8 and the bacterial UbiB proteins, which are required for CoQ biosynthesis. Three out of four patients tested showed a low endogenous pool of CoQ(10) in their fibroblasts or lymphoblasts, and two out of three patients showed impaired ubiquinone synthesis, strongly suggesting that ADCK3 is also involved in CoQ(10) biosynthesis. The deleterious nature of the three identified missense changes was confirmed by the introduction of them at the corresponding positions of the yeast COQ8 gene. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis shows that ADCK3 belongs to the family of atypical kinases, which includes phosphoinositide and choline kinases, suggesting that ADCK3 plays an indirect regulatory role in ubiquinone biosynthesis possibly as part of a feedback loop that regulates ATP production.&#9;&#9;&#9;18392411&#9;Language brain dominance in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy: a comparative study between functional magnetic resonance imaging and dichotic listening test.&#9;&#9;PURPOSE: To identify brain dominance for language functions with DLT and correlate these results with those obtained from fMRI in patients suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.&#9;METHOD: This study reports on 13 patients who underwent pre-surgical epileptic evaluation between April and October 2004 at the Epilepsy Surgery Program, Hospital Sao Lucas, PUCRS. In DLT, dominance was assessed through a consonant-vowel task, whereas in fMRI patients performed a verb generation task.&#9;RESULTS: Our results identified a correlation between the fMRI lateralization index and the DLT ear predominance index and reply difference index (r=0.6, p=0.02; Pearson Correlation Coefficient), showing positive correlation between results obtained from fMRI and DLT.&#9;CONCLUSION: DLT was found to significantly correlate with fMRI. These findings indicate that DLT (a non-invasive procedure) could be a useful tool to evaluate language brain dominance in pre-surgical epileptic patients as it is cheaper to perform than fMRI.&#9;&#9;&#9;18398004&#9;Artificial miRNAs mitigate shRNA-mediated toxicity in the brain: implications for the therapeutic development of RNAi.&#9;&#9;Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene, which encodes the huntingtin protein. We and others have shown that RNAi is a candidate therapy for HD because expression of inhibitory RNAs targeting mutant human HD transgenes improved neuropathology and behavioral deficits in HD mouse models. Here, we developed shRNAs targeting conserved sequences in human HD and mouse HD homolog (HDh) mRNAs to initiate preclinical testing in a knockin mouse model of HD. We screened 35 shRNAs in vitro and subsequently narrowed our focus to three candidates for in vivo testing. Unexpectedly, two active shRNAs induced significant neurotoxicity in mouse striatum, although HDh mRNA expression was reduced to similar levels by all three. Additionally, a control shRNA containing mismatches also induced toxicity, although it did not reduce HDh mRNA expression. Interestingly, the toxic shRNAs generated higher antisense RNA levels, compared with the nontoxic shRNA. These results demonstrate that the robust levels of antisense RNAs emerging from shRNA expression systems can be problematic in the mouse brain. Importantly, when sequences that were toxic in the context of shRNAs were placed into artificial microRNA (miRNA) expression systems, molecular and neuropathological readouts of neurotoxicity were significantly attenuated without compromising mouse HDh silencing efficacy. Thus, miRNA-based approaches may provide more appropriate biological tools for expressing inhibitory RNAs in the brain, the implications of which are crucial to the development of RNAi for both basic biological and therapeutic applications.&#9;&#9;&#9;18405054&#9;Changes of the corpus callosum in children who suffered perinatal injury of the periventricular crossroads of pathways.&#9;&#9;There is a high incidence of periventricular leukomalacia, caused by hypoxia-ischemia, in preterm infants. These lesions damage the periventricular crossroads of commissural, projection and associative pathways, which are in a close topographical relationship with the lateral ventricles. We explored to what extent abnormalities of echogenicity of the periventricular crossroads correlate with changes in size of the corpus callosum. Our study included nine infants (gestation from 26-41 weeks; birth weight between 938-4450 grams) with perinatal brain injury. Periventricular areas, which topographically correspond to the frontal, main and occipital crossroad, were readily visualized by cranial ultrasound scans, performed during the first two weeks after birth. Corpus callosum mediosagittal area measurements were performed using magnetic resonance images, acquired between the first and sixth postnatal month (postmenstrual age 40-49 weeks). We found a statistically significant correlation between the increased echogenicity in the crossroad areas and the decrease of the corpus callosum midsagittal area (p &lt; 0.05). This supports the hypothesis that callosal fibers can be damaged, during growth through the periventricular crossroads of pathways.&#9;&#9;&#9;18434550&#9;Loss of microRNA cluster miR-29a/b-1 in sporadic Alzheimer's disease correlates with increased BACE1/beta-secretase expression.&#9;&#9;Although the role of APP and PSEN genes in genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is well established, fairly little is known about the molecular mechanisms affecting Abeta generation in sporadic AD. Deficiency in Abeta clearance is certainly a possibility, but increased expression of proteins like APP or BACE1/beta-secretase may also be associated with the disease. We therefore investigated changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of sporadic AD patients and found that several miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression appeared to be decreased in diseased brain. We show here that miR-29a, -29b-1, and -9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro. The miR-29a/b-1 cluster was significantly (and AD-dementia-specific) decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein. Similar correlations between expression of this cluster and BACE1 were found during brain development and in primary neuronal cultures. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential causal relationship between miR-29a/b-1 expression and Abeta generation in a cell culture model. We propose that loss of specific miRNAs can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD.&#9;&#9;&#9;18525125&#9;Identification of miRNA changes in Alzheimer's disease brain and CSF yields putative biomarkers and insights into disease pathways.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs have essential functional roles in brain development and neuronal specification but their roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. Using a sensitive qRT-PCR platform we identified regional and stage-specific deregulation of miRNA expression in AD patient brains. We used experimental validation in addition to literature to reveal how the deregulated brain microRNAs are biomarkers for known and novel pathways in AD pathogenesis related to amyloid processing, neurogenesis, insulin resistance, and innate immunity. We additionally recovered miRNAs from cerebrospinal fluid and discovered AD-specific miRNA changes consistent with their role as potential biomarkers of disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;18541114&#9;MicroRNAs in brain function and disease.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small, non-protein-coding transcripts about 21 nucleotides long, have recently entered center stage in the study of posttranscriptional gene regulation. They are now thought to be involved in the control of about one third of all protein-coding genes and play a role in the majority of cellular processes that have been studied. We focus on the role of the miRNA pathway in brain development, function, and disease by highlighting recent observations with respect to miRNA-mediated gene regulation in neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and the circadian clock. We also discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the involvement of miRNAs in the etiopathology of brain disorders and pinpoint the emerging therapeutic potential of miRNAs for the treatment of human diseases.&#9;&#9;&#9;18563458&#9;Heterogeneous dysregulation of microRNAs across the autism spectrum.&#9;&#9;microRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nt transcripts capable of regulating the expression of many mRNAs and are abundant in the brain. miRNAs have a role in several complex diseases including cancer as well as some neurological diseases such as Tourette's syndrome and Fragile x syndrome. As a genetically complex disease, dysregulation of miRNA expression might be a feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared the expression of 466 human miRNAs from postmortem cerebellar cortex tissue of individuals with ASD (n = 13) and a control set of non-autistic cerebellar samples (n = 13). While most miRNAs levels showed little variation across all samples suggesting that autism does not induce global dysfunction of miRNA expression, some miRNAs among the autistic samples were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the mean control value. Twenty-eight miRNAs were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the non-autism control set in at least one of the autism samples. To validate the finding, we reversed the analysis and compared each non-autism control to a single mean value for each miRNA across all autism cases. In this analysis, the number of dysregulated miRNAs fell from 28 to 9 miRNAs. Among the predicted targets of dysregulated miRNAs are genes that are known genetic causes of autism such Neurexin and SHANK3. This study finds that altered miRNA expression levels are observed in postmortem cerebellar cortex from autism patients, a finding which suggests that dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to autism spectrum phenotype.&#9;&#9;&#9;18577221&#9;MicroRNAs: regulators of oncogenesis and stemness.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential post-transcriptional regulators that determine cell identity and fate. Aberrant expression of miRNAs can lead to diseases, including cancer. Expression of many miRNAs in the de-differentiated brain tumor cancer stem cells resembles that of neural stem cells. In this issue of BMC Medicine, Silber et al provide evidence of the expression of such miRNAs and their potential to mediate differentiation in both stem cell populations. In this commentary, we discuss the known functions of miRNAs in cancer and stem cells, their therapeutic potential and how the findings of Silber et al provide insight into the role of miR-124/miR-137 dysregulation in glioblastomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;18619557&#9;MicroRNAs in diseases and drug response.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Since the discovery of the first miRNA gene lin-4 in C. elegans, over 500 miRNAs have been identified in humans and the list is growing. Their biological importance, initially demonstrated in cancer, was also more recently discovered in many other pathologies like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, viral infections, diabetes, and myopathies. In the present review we will summarize miRNA profiling studies in human diseases and discuss the newly discovered link between microRNAs and drug response. An understanding of how microRNAs influence the body's response to certain drugs and how these affect the expression of microRNAs, will be of key importance in developing drugs with greater safety and efficacy.&#9;&#9;&#9;18684319&#9;MicroRNAs can regulate human APP levels.&#9;&#9;ABSTRACT: A number of studies have shown that increased APP levels, resulting from either a genomic locus duplication or alteration in APP regulatory sequences, can lead to development of early-onset dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, understanding how APP levels are regulated could provide valuable insight into the genetic basis of AD and illuminate novel therapeutic avenues for AD. Here we test the hypothesis that APP protein levels can be regulated by miRNAs, evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNA molecules that play an important role in regulating gene expression. Utilizing human cell lines, we demonstrate that miRNAs hsa-mir-106a and hsa-mir-520c bind to their predicted target sequences in the APP 3'UTR and negatively regulate reporter gene expression. Over-expression of these miRNAs, but not control miRNAs, results in translational repression of APP mRNA and significantly reduces APP protein levels. These results are the first to demonstrate that levels of human APP can be regulated by miRNAs.&#9;&#9;&#9;18723524&#9;Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia.&#9;&#9;Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) cause ubiquitin- and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-U), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 10% of early-onset dementia patients. Here we expand the role of GRN in FTLD-U and demonstrate that a common genetic variant (rs5848), located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GRN in a binding-site for miR-659, is a major susceptibility factor for FTLD-U. In a series of pathologically confirmed FTLD-U patients without GRN mutations, we show that carriers homozygous for the T-allele of rs5848 have a 3.2-fold increased risk to develop FTLD-U compared with homozygous C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73). We further demonstrate that miR-659 can regulate GRN expression in vitro, with miR-659 binding more efficiently to the high risk T-allele of rs5848 resulting in augmented translational inhibition of GRN. A significant reduction in GRN protein was observed in homozygous T-allele carriers in vivo, through biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, mimicking the effect of heterozygous loss-of-function GRN mutations. In support of these findings, the neuropathology of homozygous rs5848 T-allele carriers frequently resembled the pathological FTLD-U subtype of GRN mutation carriers. We suggest that the expression of GRN is regulated by miRNAs and that common genetic variability in a miRNA binding-site can significantly increase the risk for FTLD-U. Translational regulation by miRNAs may represent a common mechanism underlying complex neurodegenerative disorders.&#9;&#9;&#9;18778868&#9;MicroRNA target site polymorphisms and human disease.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. They have been implicated in a broad range of biological processes, and miRNA-related genetic alterations probably underlie more human diseases than currently appreciated. Several studies have identified genetic variants in miRNA target sites that are claimed to be associated with disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease to cancer. However, careful assessment of these studies indicates that very few provide a combination of rigorous genetic and functional evidence. We therefore suggest a set of concrete recommendations to guide future investigations. Specifically, we highlight the importance of unbiased association studies and follow-up functional experiments for providing a clearer picture of the extent to which microRNA target site variations are relevant in various human diseases.&#9;&#9;&#9;18792561&#9;[Cryptococcal meningitis as a diagnostic problem in a patient with SLE--case report].&#9;&#9;Systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE) is a disease with wide range of clinical manifestations, signs and symptoms. Disease outcome depends mostly on the affection of kidneys and central nervous system by the disease. Very important cause of death in patients with SLE is infection. Infections are very common among these patients due to aggressive immunosuppressive treatment that is needed for the disease inflammatory activity control. In this case report we have presented a patient with SLE who initially had severe renal affection, but also complications of immunosuppressive therapy that was administered. Even though the disease was accidentally diagnosed, it had a severe clinical progress. Because of lupus nephropathy, in the early phase of the disease we administered aggressive immunosuppressive therapy (combined parenteral therapy of glucocorticoides and cyclophosphamide). As an outcome of the combined effect of disease and immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of the disease, the patient had increased infective diathesis (repeated infections caused by S. enteritidis--urinary infections and sepsis). During one of the disease flares the patient was hospitalized an opportunistic infection developed. It was meningitis caused by C. neoformans. This opportunistic mycosis infection presented with clinically totally nonspecific signs and symptoms of CNS affection. Therefore, we suspected affection of CNS with SLE. Even though all diagnostic procedures were made on time and that adequate antifungal and supportive agents were applied very early after the infection onset, the outcome was fatal. Because of infective diathesis in patients with SLE, which present with common and opportunistic infections, and due to high mortality rates caused by these infections, we have tried to emphasise the importance of taking adequate specimens early after infection outcome for these rare infective agents like C. neophormans. In recent medical literature are dominant cases reported in Asia. Reports from Europe are very rare, and this case is the one of that kind in Croatia.&#9;&#9;&#9;18801740&#9;An NF-kappaB-sensitive micro RNA-146a-mediated inflammatory circuit in Alzheimer disease and in stressed human brain cells.&#9;&#9;Human brains retain discrete populations of micro RNA (miRNA) species that support homeostatic brain gene expression functions; however, specific miRNA abundance is significantly altered in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) when compared with age-matched controls. Here we provide evidence in AD brains of a specific up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a highly complementary to the 3'-untranslated region of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of the inflammatory response of the brain. Up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of CFH was observed in AD brain and in interleukin-1beta, Abeta42, and/or oxidatively stressed human neural (HN) cells in primary culture. Transfection of HN cells using an NF-kappaB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression. Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrollidine dithiocarbamate or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response. Incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to miRNA-146a (anti-miRNA-146a; AM-146a) was found to restore CFH expression levels. These data indicate that NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a-mediated modulation of CFH gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in AD brain and in stressed HN cell models of AD and illustrate the potential for anti-miRNAs as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling.&#9;&#9;&#9;18805830&#9;Microdeletion/duplication at 15q13.2q13.3 among individuals with features of autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Segmental duplications at breakpoints (BP4-BP5) of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 mediate a recurrent genomic imbalance syndrome associated with mental retardation, epilepsy, and/or electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities.&#9;PATIENTS: DNA samples from 1445 unrelated patients submitted consecutively for clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) testing at Children's Hospital Boston and DNA samples from 1441 individuals with autism from 751 families in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) repository.&#9;RESULTS: We report the clinical features of five patients with a BP4-BP5 deletion, three with a BP4-BP5 duplication, and two with an overlapping but smaller duplication identified by whole genome high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH. These BP4-BP5 deletion cases exhibit minor dysmorphic features, significant expressive language deficits, and a spectrum of neuropsychiatric impairments that include autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, and mood disorder. Cognitive impairment varied from moderate mental retardation to normal IQ with learning disability. BP4-BP5 covers approximately 1.5 Mb (chr15:28.719-30.298 Mb) and includes six reference genes and 1 miRNA gene, while the smaller duplications cover approximately 500 kb (chr15:28.902-29.404 Mb) and contain three reference genes and one miRNA gene. The BP4-BP5 deletion and duplication events span CHRNA7, a candidate gene for seizures. However, none of these individuals reported here have epilepsy, although two have an abnormal EEG.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 BP4-BP5 microdeletion/duplication syndrome may include features of autism spectrum disorder, a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Recognition of this broader phenotype has implications for clinical diagnostic testing and efforts to understand the underlying aetiology of this syndrome.&#9;&#9;&#9;18836290&#9;Epigenetic changes in gliomas.&#9;&#9;Epigenetics are defined, in broad-terms, as alterations in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. While histone modifications and DNA methylation are two classical means to regulate gene expression, miRNA has also recently been documented to govern gene expression in normal as well as cancer cells. In this review, we will first describe briefly histone modifications, DNA methylation and miRNAs and the functions of these epigenetic marks during different cellular processes involving DNA metabolism. We will then highlight some epigenetic changes in glioblastomas, a malignant form of brain tumor, and potential application of epigenetic means for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of gliomas. We expect that novel therapies will be developed to counter epigenetic changes in this deadly disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;18840638&#9;MicroRNAs differentially expressed in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.&#9;&#9;CONTEXT: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, functioning as antisense regulators of gene expression by targeting mRNA and contributing to cancer development and progression. More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites of the genome. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze the differential expression of let-7a, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-141, miR-143, miR-145, and miR-150 in corticotropinomas and normal pituitary tissue and verify whether their profile of expression correlates with tumor size or remission after treatment.&#9;MATERIAL AND METHODS: ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor samples were obtained during transphenoidal surgery from patients with Cushing disease and normal pituitary tissues from autopsies. The relative expression of miRNAs was measured by real-time PCR using RNU44 and RNU49 as endogenous controls. Relative quantification of miRNA expression was calculated using the 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method.&#9;RESULTS: We found underexpression of miR-145 (2.0-fold; P = 0.04), miR-21 (2.4-fold; P = 0.004), miR-141 (2.6-fold; P = 0.02), let-7a (3.3-fold; P = 0.003), miR-150 (3.8-fold; P = 0.04), miR-15a (4.5-fold; P = 0.03), miR-16 (5.0-fold; P = 0.004), and miR-143 (6.4-fold; P = 0.004) in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors when compared to normal pituitary tissues. There were no differences between miRNA expression and tumor size as well as miRNA expression and ratio of remission after surgery, except in patients presenting lower miR-141 expression who showed a better chance of remission.&#9;CONCLUSION: Our results support the possibility that altered miRNA expression profile might be involved in corticotrophic tumorigenesis. However, the lack of knowledge about miRNA target genes postpones full understanding of the biological functions of down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs in corticotropinomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;18928881&#9;Non-MS autoimmune demyelination.&#9;&#9;Connective tissue diseases can be characterised by central nervous system (CNS) involvement, in some patients manifested by demyelination areas in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which are difficult to differentiate from multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating processes, such as transverse myelitis and optic neuritis. Demyelinating process may be the feature of nervous impairment in systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease (BD), Sjoegren's syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc) or very rarely other systemic autoimmune diseases. An acute isolated neurological syndrome, as the most common symptom of MS can sometimes be the only feature or even first manifestation of nervous impairment in connective tissue disease, hence presenting the diagnostic problem. Although the white matter abnormalities seen by magnetic resonance imaging may be similar in non-MS autoimmune demyelination and MS, it is the most important diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of the mentioned conditions. Investigating the presence of various autoantibodies potentially involved in the pathogenesis of demyelinating lesions as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be helpful.&#9;&#9;&#9;18951327&#9;MicroRNAs and possible role in pituitary adenoma.&#9;&#9;This review reports the current knowledge of microRNA (miRNA) expression in pituitary adenomas, focusing on recent microarray data. Moreover, a discussion is provided concerning the possible role of validated and putative targets of the most dysregulated miRNA in pituitary adenoma pathogenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;18986230&#9;Targeting miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;18986979&#9;MicroRNA-298 and microRNA-328 regulate expression of mouse beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme 1.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulatory RNAs known to repress mRNA translation through recognition of specific binding sites located mainly in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Loss of specific miRNA control of gene expression is thus expected to underlie serious genetic diseases. Intriguingly, previous post-mortem analyses showed higher beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme (BACE) protein, but not mRNA, levels in the brain of patients that suffered from Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we also observed a loss of correlation between BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3'-UTR element and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) cells. Through various experimental approaches, we validated computational predictions and demonstrated that miR-298 and miR-328 recognize specific binding sites in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA and exert regulatory effects on BACE1 protein expression in cultured neuronal cells. Our results may provide the molecular basis underlying BACE1 deregulation in AD and offer new perspectives on the etiology of this neurological disorder.&#9;&#9;&#9;18987751&#9;A miRNA signature of prion induced neurodegeneration.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules which are emerging as key regulators of numerous cellular processes. Compelling evidence links miRNAs to the control of neuronal development and differentiation, however, little is known about their role in neurodegeneration. We used microarrays and RT-PCR to profile miRNA expression changes in the brains of mice infected with mouse-adapted scrapie. We determined 15 miRNAs were de-regulated during the disease processes; miR-342-3p, miR-320, let-7b, miR-328, miR-128, miR-139-5p and miR-146a were over 2.5 fold up-regulated and miR-338-3p and miR-337-3p over 2.5 fold down-regulated. Only one of these miRNAs, miR-128, has previously been shown to be de-regulated in neurodegenerative disease. De-regulation of a unique subset of miRNAs suggests a conserved, disease-specific pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs is associated with prion-induced neurodegeneration. Computational analysis predicted numerous potential gene targets of these miRNAs, including 119 genes previously determined to be also de-regulated in mouse scrapie. We used a co-ordinated approach to integrate miRNA and mRNA profiling, bioinformatic predictions and biochemical validation to determine miRNA regulated processes and genes potentially involved in disease progression. In particular, a correlation between miRNA expression and putative gene targets involved in intracellular protein-degradation pathways and signaling pathways related to cell death, synapse function and neurogenesis was identified.&#9;&#9;&#9;19021292&#9;Traumatic brain injury alters expression of hippocampal microRNAs: potential regulators of multiple pathophysiological processes.&#9;&#9;Multiple cellular, molecular, and biochemical changes contribute to outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to influence many important cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and morphogenesis, all processes that are involved in TBI pathophysiology. However, it has not yet been determined whether miRNA expression is altered after TBI. In the present study, we used a microarray platform to examine changes in the hippocampal expression levels of 444 verified rodent miRNAs at 3 and 24 hr after controlled cortical impact injury. Our analysis found 50 miRNAs exhibited decreased expression levels and 35 miRNAs exhibited increased expression levels in the hippocampus after injury. We extended the microarray findings using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for a subset of the miRNAs with altered expression levels (miR-107, -130a, -223, -292-5p, -433-3p, -451, -541, and -711). Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted targets for this panel of miRNAs revealed an overrepresentation of proteins involved in several biological processes and functions known to be initiated after injury, including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, proliferation, and differentiation. Our results indicate that multiple protein targets and biological processes involved in TBI pathophysiology may be regulated by miRNAs.&#9;&#9;&#9;19110058&#9;MicroRNA regulation of Alzheimer's Amyloid precursor protein expression.&#9;&#9;Gene dosage effects of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) can cause familial AD. Recent evidence suggest that microRNA (miRNA) pathways, implicated in gene transcriptional control, could be involved in the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore investigated whether miRNAs could participate in the regulation of APP gene expression. We show that miRNAs belonging to the miR-20a family (that is, miR-20a, miR-17-5p and miR-106b) could regulate APP expression in vitro and at the endogenous level in neuronal cell lines. A tight correlation between these miRNAs and APP was found during brain development and in differentiating neurons. We thus identify miRNAs as novel endogenous regulators of APP expression, suggesting that variations in miRNA expression could contribute to changes in APP expression in the brain during development and disease. This possibility is further corroborated by the observation that a statistically significant decrease in miR-106b expression was found in sporadic AD patients.&#9;&#9;&#9;19118166&#9;The bifunctional microRNA miR-9/miR-9* regulates REST and CoREST and is downregulated in Huntington's disease.&#9;&#9;The transcription factor REST silences neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. In neurons, the protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm in part through binding to huntingtin. Polyglutamine expansions in huntingtin, which causes Huntington's disease (HD), abrogates REST-huntingtin binding. Consequently, REST translocates to the nucleus, occupies RE1 repressor sequences and decreases neuronal gene expression. In this work, we found that levels of several microRNAs (miRNAs) with upstream RE1 sites are decreased in HD patient cortices relative to healthy controls. Interestingly, one of these, the bifunctional brain enriched miR-9/miR-9*, targets two components of the REST complex: miR-9 targets REST and miR-9* targets CoREST. These data provide evidence for a double negative feedback loop between the REST silencing complex and the miRNAs it regulates.&#9;&#9;&#9;19135980&#9;MicroRNA-15b regulates cell cycle progression by targeting cyclins in glioma cells.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-protein-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional gene regulators. Recent evidence has shown that miRNA plays a pivotal role in the development of many cancers including glioma, a lethal brain cancer. We have recently compared the miRNA expression profiles between normal brain and glioma tissues from Chinese patients by miRNA microarray and identified a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs. Here, we studied the function of one miRNA, miR-15b, in glioma carcinogenesis and elucidated its downstream targets. Over-expression of miR-15b resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase while suppression of miR-15b expression resulted in a decrease of cell populations in G0/G1 and a corresponding increase of cell populations in S phase. We further showed that CCNE1 (encoding cyclin E1) is one of the downstream targets of miR-15b. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-15b regulates cell cycle progression in glioma cells by targeting cell cycle-related molecules.&#9;&#9;&#9;19136928&#9;Overexpression of HMGA2 relates to reduction of the let-7 and its relationship to clinicopathological features in pituitary adenomas.&#9;&#9;High-mobility group A2 is highly expressed during embryogenesis and in various benign and malignant tumors. Recent studies report that high-mobility group A2 is negatively regulated by the let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) family in vitro. The development of pituitary adenomas in high-mobility group A2 transgenic mice showed that high-mobility group A2 may be involved in pituitary tumorigenesis. However, no studies have investigated the clinical significance of high-mobility group A2 and its relationship to the let-7 miRNA family in human pituitary adenomas. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed high-mobility group A2 expression with respect to various clinicopathologic factors in 98 pituitary adenomas. Overexpression of high-mobility group A2 was observed in 39% (38/98) of pituitary adenomas compared with normal adenohypophysial tissue and was frequently found in adenomas including prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone and in null cell adenomas, but relatively rare in growth hormone (GH) and mixed GH/PRL adenomas. High-mobility group A2 expression was significantly associated with tumor invasion (P&lt;0.05) and was significantly higher in grade IV than in grades I, II, and III adenomas (P&lt;0.05). High levels of high-mobility group A2 expression were more frequently observed in macroadenomas than in microadenomas (P&lt;0.05). High levels of high-mobility group A2 expression also significantly correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67 (P&lt;0.0001). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out to evaluate the expression of let-7 in 55 pituitary adenomas. Subsequently, decreased expression of let-7 was confirmed in 23 of 55 (42%) adenomas and was correlated with high-grade tumors (P&lt;0.05). An inverse correlation between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 expression was evident (R=-0.33, P&lt;0.05). These findings support a causal link between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 whereby loss of let-7 expression induces high-mobility group A2 upregulation that represents an important mechanism in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression.&#9;&#9;&#9;19142192&#9;Transient focal ischemia induces extensive temporal changes in rat cerebral microRNAome.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotides long, noncoding RNAs that control cellular function by either degrading mRNAs or arresting their translation. To understand their functional significance in ischemic pathophysiology, we profiled miRNAs in adult rat brain as a function of reperfusion time after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Of the 238 miRNAs evaluated, 8 showed increased and 12 showed decreased expression at least at 4 out of 5 reperfusion time points studied between 3 h and 3 days compared with sham. Of those, 17 showed &gt;5 fold change. Bioinformatics analysis indicated a correlation between miRNAs altered to several mRNAs known to mediate inflammation, transcription, neuroprotection, receptors function, and ionic homeostasis. Antagomir-mediated prevention of mir-145 expression led to an increased protein expression of its downstream target superoxide dismutase-2 in the postischemic brain. In silico analysis showed sequence complementarity of eight miRNAs induced after focal ischemia to 877 promoters indicating the possibility of noncoding RNA-induced activation of gene expression. The mRNA expression of the RNases Drosha and Dicer, cofactor Pasha, and the pre-miRNA transporter exportin-5, which modulate miRNA biogenesis, were not altered after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Thus, the present studies indicate a critical role of miRNAs in controlling mRNA transcription and translation in the postischemic brain.&#9;&#9;&#9;19159078&#9;miR-21 and 221 upregulation and miR-181b downregulation in human grade II-IV astrocytic tumors.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNAs that reduce stability and/or translation of fully or partially sequence-complementary target mRNAs. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs can function both as tumor suppressors and as oncogenes. It has been demonstrated that in glioblastoma multiforme miR-21 and 221 are upregulated whereas miR-128 and 181 are downregulated. Expression of miR-21, 221, 128a, 128b, 128c, 181a, 181b, 181c was studied using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting for human astrocytic tumors with different grade of malignancy. miR-21 and 221 were overexpressed in glioma samples, whereas miRNA 181b was downregulated compared with normal brain tissue. miRNA-21 was hyperexpressed in all tumor samples whereas higher levels of miRNA-221 were found in high-grade gliomas. This study is the first analysis of miRNAs in astrocytic tumor at different stages of malignancy. The different expression pattern observed in tumors at different stages of malignancy is probably dependent on the cell-specific repertoire of target genes of tumors sharing different molecular pathways activity and suggests miRNAs may have also a place in diagnosis and staging of brain tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;19175699&#9;miR-21: a small multi-faceted RNA.&#9;&#9;More than 1000 microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in human cells, some tissue or cell type specific, others considered as house-keeping molecules. Functions and direct mRNA targets for some miRNAs have been relatively well studied over the last years. Every miRNA potentially regulates the expression of numerous protein-coding genes (tens to hundreds), but it has become increasingly clear that not all miRNAs are equally important; diverse high-throughput screenings of various systems have identified a limited number of key functional miRNAs over and over again. Particular miRNAs emerge as principal regulators that control major cell functions in various physiological and pathophysiological settings. Since its identification 3 years ago as the miRNA most commonly and strongly up-regulated in human brain tumour glioblastoma [1], miR-21 has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields, such as development, oncology, stem cell biology and aging, becoming one of the most studied miRNAs, along with let-7, miR-17-92 cluster ('oncomir-1'), miR-155 and a few others. However, an miR-21 knockout mouse has not yet been generated, and the data about miR-21 functions in normal cells are still very limited. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of miR-21 functions in human disease, with an emphasis on its regulation, oncogenic role, targets in human cancers, potential as a disease biomarker and novel therapeutic target in oncology.&#9;&#9;&#9;19196975&#9;The miR-17~92 cluster collaborates with the Sonic Hedgehog pathway in medulloblastoma.&#9;&#9;Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common brain tumors in children. Some are thought to originate from cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) that fail to undergo normal cell cycle exit and differentiation. Because microRNAs regulate numerous aspects of cellular physiology and development, we reasoned that alterations in miRNA expression might contribute to MB. We tested this hypothesis using 2 spontaneous mouse MB models with specific initiating mutations, Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- and Ink4c-/-; p53-/-. We found that 26 miRNAs showed increased expression and 24 miRNAs showed decreased expression in proliferating mouse GNPs and MBs relative to mature mouse cerebellum, regardless of genotype. Among the 26 overexpressed miRNAs, 9 were encoded by the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster family, a group of microRNAs implicated as oncogenes in several tumor types. Analysis of human MBs demonstrated that 3 miR-17 approximately 92 cluster miRNAs (miR-92, miR-19a, and miR-20) were also overexpressed in human MBs with a constitutively activated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, but not in other forms of the disease. To test whether the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster could promote MB formation, we enforced expression of these miRNAs in GNPs isolated from cerebella of postnatal (P) day P6 Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- mice. These, but not similarly engineered cells from Ink4c-/-; p53-/- mice, formed MBs in orthotopic transplants with complete penetrance. Interestingly, orthotopic mouse tumors ectopically expressing miR-17 approximately 92 lost expression of the wild-type Ptch1 allele. Our findings suggest a functional collaboration between the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster and the SHH signaling pathway in the development of MBs in mouse and man.&#9;&#9;&#9;19251578&#9;Epilepsy surgery in the elderly: an unusual case of a 75-year-old man with recurrent status epilepticus.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Epilepsy surgery is increasingly well-supported as an effective treatment for patients with intractable epilepsy. It is most often performed on younger patients and the safety and efficacy of epilepsy surgery in elderly patients are not frequently described.&#9;CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 75-year-old right-handed man who underwent a left fronto-temporal craniotomy for resection of a suprasellar meningioma in 2002. Immediately following hospital discharge, he began to experience complex partial seizures. He continued to have frequent seizures despite treatment with multiple combinations of antiepileptic medications. He presented with status epilepticus every two or three months, and required long periods of hospitalization on each occasion for post-ictal confusion and aphasia. Scalp EEG showed continuous spikes and polyspikes and persistent slowing in the left temporal area, as well as spikes in the left frontal area. EEG telemetry recorded multiple seizures, all with a clear focus in the left temporal area. MRI scan showed an area of encephalomalacia in the left temporal lobe, as well as post-surgical changes in the left frontal area. Neuropsychological testing showed bilateral memory impairment with no significant cognitive decline expected after unilateral temporal lobe resection. A left anteromesial temporal lobectomy was performed with intraoperative electrocorticography. Since surgery, the patient was not seizure-free (Engel class II-b), but had no further episodes of status epilepticus in one year and two months of follow-up.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the oldest patients reported in the literature with epilepsy surgery and supports the possibility of epilepsy surgery in elderly patients for particular cases. In addition, few cases with such a malignant evolution of temporal lobe epilepsy have been described in this age group.&#9;&#9;&#9;19262177&#9;Glioma angiogenesis: Towards novel RNA therapeutics.&#9;&#9;Brain tumors exhibit marked and aberrant blood vessel formation indicating angiogenic endothelial cells as a potential target for brain tumor treatment. The brain tumor blood vessels are used for nutrient delivery, and possibly for cancer cell migration. The process of angiogenesis is complex and involves multiple players. The current angiogenesis inhibitors used in clinical trials mostly target single angiogenic proteins and so far show limited effects on tumor growth. Besides the conventional angiogenesis inhibitors, RNA-based inhibitors such as small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are being analyzed for their capacity to silence the message of proteins involved in neovascularization. More recently, a new family of non-coding RNAs, named angiomirs [microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in angiogenesis] has emerged. These small RNAs have the advantage over siRNAs in that they have the potential of silencing multiple messages at the same time and therefore they might become therapeutically relevant in a &quot;one-hit multiple-target&quot; context against brain tumor angiogenesis. In this review we will discuss the emerging technologies in anti-angiogenesis emphasizing on RNA-based therapeutics.&#9;&#9;&#9;19308264&#9;MicroRNA-199b-5p impairs cancer stem cells through negative regulation of HES1 in medulloblastoma.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Through negative regulation of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) can function in cancers as oncosuppressors, and they can show altered expression in various tumor types. Here we have investigated medulloblastoma tumors (MBs), which arise from an early impairment of developmental processes in the cerebellum, where Notch signaling is involved in many cell-fate-determining stages. MBs occur bimodally, with the peak incidence seen between 3-4 years and 8-9 years of age, although it can also occur in adults. Notch regulates a subset of the MB cells that have stem-cell-like properties and can promote tumor growth. On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that miRNAs targeting the Notch pathway can regulated these phenomena, and can be used in anti-cancer therapies.&#9;METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a screening of MB cell lines, the miRNA miR-199b-5p was seen to be a regulator of the Notch pathway through its targeting of the transcription factor HES1. Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells. MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133+) subpopulation of cells. In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P = 0.001). Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients. These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations. Upon induction of de-methylation using 5-aza-deoxycytidine, lower miR-199b-5p expression was seen in a panel of MB cell lines, supported an epigenetic mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment. Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.&#9;CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MB, one-third of these patients remain incurable and current treatments can significantly damage long-term survivors. Here we show that miR-199b-5p expression correlates with metastasis spread, identifying a new molecular marker for a poor-risk class in patients with MB. We further show that in a xenograft model, MB tumor burden can be reduced, indicating the use of miR199b-5p as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, for the improvement of anti-cancer MB therapies and patient quality of life. To date, this is the first report that expression of a miRNA can deplete the tumor stem cells, indicating an interesting therapeutic approach for the targeting of these cells in brain tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;19343354&#9;Oncogenic role of microRNAs in brain tumors.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-protein-coding RNAs that function as key regulators of diverse biological processes through negative control on gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Emerging evidence indicates that miRNAs play an important role in the development of human cancers, with their deregulation resulting in altered activity of downstream tumor suppressors, oncogenes and other signaling molecules. Recent years have seen considerable progress in miRNA research in brain tumors, particularly in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of these malignant lesions. Expression profiling has unveiled miRNA signatures that not only distinguish brain tumors from normal tissues, but can also differentiate histotypes or molecular subtypes with altered genetic pathways. Moreover, specific miRNA subsets may have potential diagnostic and prognostic values in some brain tumors. Several deregulated miRNAs uncovered in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas have their gene targets and the associated genetic pathways identified. This review summarizes recent findings of miRNA study in brain tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;19351822&#9;The miR-17/92 polycistron is up-regulated in sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastomas and induced by N-myc in sonic hedgehog-treated cerebellar neural precursors.&#9;&#9;Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, and mechanisms underlying its development are poorly understood. We identified recurrent amplification of the miR-17/92 polycistron proto-oncogene in 6% of pediatric medulloblastomas by high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays and subsequent interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization on a human medulloblastoma tissue microarray. Profiling the expression of 427 mature microRNAs (miRNA) in a series of 90 primary human medulloblastomas revealed that components of the miR-17/92 polycistron are the most highly up-regulated miRNAs in medulloblastoma. Expression of miR-17/92 was highest in the subgroup of medulloblastomas associated with activation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway compared with other subgroups of medulloblastoma. Medulloblastomas in which miR-17/92 was up-regulated also had elevated levels of MYC/MYCN expression. Consistent with its regulation by Shh, we observed that Shh treatment of primary cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), proposed cells of origin for the Shh-associated medulloblastomas, resulted in increased miR-17/92 expression. In CGNPs, the Shh effector N-myc, but not Gli1, induced miR-17/92 expression. Ectopic miR-17/92 expression in CGNPs synergized with exogenous Shh to increase proliferation and also enabled them to proliferate in the absence of Shh. We conclude that miR-17/92 is a positive effector of Shh-mediated proliferation and that aberrant expression/amplification of this miR confers a growth advantage to medulloblastomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;19393719&#9;In situ hybridization is a necessary experimental complement to microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling in the human brain.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play fundamental roles in human brain neurochemistry. However, much remains to be learned in this fast-paced field. To understand how miRNAs contribute to normal biologic functions and disease states, it is critical to understand the miRNAs that are expressed in particular cell types under a range of conditions. Many tools have been developed to help describe the repertoire of miRNAs present at the tissue level in a given sample. However, tissue level miRNA profiling is inadequate to pinpoint the cellular and sub-cellular distribution of individual miRNAs. Such knowledge is especially important in the nervous system with its many cell types, microscopic heterogeneity with regard to functionally distinct cell groups, and extreme geometrical complexity in cellular shapes. We have found that in situ hybridization shows important cerebral cortical lamina-specific patterns of miRNA expression that would be lost on most tissue level expression studies, and these lamina-specific patterns can be directly relevant to human brain disease. Thus, in situ hybridization is an important experimental complement to tissue level miRNA expression profiling. Technical and theoretical aspects of this important technique are described, especially those pertinent to studying the human brain.&#9;&#9;&#9;19406203&#9;Micro-RNA abundance and stability in human brain: specific alterations in Alzheimer's disease temporal lobe neocortex.&#9;&#9;Micro-RNA (miRNA) mediated regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) complexity in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging as a critical factor in the control of CNS-specific gene expression during development, plasticity, aging and disease. In these studies, miRNA array and Northern blot based tracking of specific miRNA abundances and decay kinetics in human neural (HN) cells in primary culture and in short post-mortem interval (PMI, approximately 1h) human brain tissues showed a limited stability and relatively short half-life ( approximately 1-3.5h) for specific brain-enriched miRNAs. In short PMI Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected temporal lobe neocortex, miRNA-9, miRNA-125b and miRNA-146a were found to be significantly up-regulated, an effect that was not seen in several related neurological disorders. The results suggest (a) that unless specifically stabilized, certain brain-enriched miRNAs represent a rapidly executed signaling system employing highly transient effectors of CNS gene expression, and (b) that in AD temporal lobe neocortex specific brain miRNAs are significantly up-regulated in abundance and strongly correlate with the presence of AD-type neuropatholgical change.&#9;&#9;&#9;19415117&#9;Tissue and process specific microRNA-mRNA co-expression in mammalian development and malignancy.&#9;&#9;An association between enrichment and depletion of microRNA (miRNA) binding sites, 3' UTR length, and mRNA expression has been demonstrated in various developing tissues and tissues from different mature organs; but functional, context-dependent miRNA regulations have yet to be elucidated. Towards that goal, we examined miRNA-mRNA interactions by measuring miRNA and mRNA in the same tissue during development and also in malignant conditions. We identified significant miRNA-mediated biological process categories in developing mouse cerebellum and lung using non-targeted mRNA expression as the negative control. Although miRNAs in general suppress target mRNA messages, many predicted miRNA targets demonstrate a significantly higher level of co-expression than non-target genes in developing cerebellum. This phenomenon is tissue specific since it is not observed in developing lungs. Comparison of mouse cerebellar development and medulloblastoma demonstrates a shared miRNA-mRNA co-expression program for brain-specific neurologic processes such as synaptic transmission and exocytosis, in which miRNA target expression increases with the accumulation of multiple miRNAs in developing cerebellum and decreases with the loss of these miRNAs in brain tumors. These findings demonstrate the context-dependence of miRNA-mRNA co-expression.&#9;&#9;&#9;19462468&#9;APP and BACE1 miRNA genetic variability has no major role in risk for Alzheimer disease.&#9;&#9;Expression levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site amyloid (Abeta) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) have been implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. In a well-characterized Belgian group of 358 AD patients and 462 controls, we examined whether genetic variability in microRNA (miRNA) binding sites of APP and BACE1 or in associated miRNAs influenced risk for AD. Direct sequencing identified six variants in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of APP and 29 variants in the 3' UTR of BACE1, of which few variants were restricted to patients: in APP; 4 variants in 6 patients ( approximately 2%) and in BACE1; 7 variants in 11 patients ( approximately 3.5%). Further genetic screening of the miR-29 cluster encoding the miR-29a/b-1 genes showed 10 variants in close proximity of this cluster. Association studies using all common variants detected in the 3' UTR of BACE1 and the miR-29 gene cluster did not identify an association with AD risk. However, we did observe statistical interaction between rs535860 (BACE1 3' UTR) and rs34772568 (near miR29a; odds ratio [OR](interaction), 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.96; P=0.033). While the exact role of the patient-specific miRNA variants within the 3' UTR region of APP and BACE1 demands further analyses, this study does not support a major contribution of miRNA genetic variability to AD pathogenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;19487573&#9;The PTEN-regulating microRNA miR-26a is amplified in high-grade glioma and facilitates gliomagenesis in vivo.&#9;&#9;Activated oncogenic signaling is central to the development of nearly all forms of cancer, including the most common class of primary brain tumor, glioma. Research over the last two decades has revealed the particular importance of the Akt pathway, and its molecular antagonist PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), in the process of gliomagenesis. Recent studies have also demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be responsible for the modulation of cancer-implicated genes in tumors. Here we report the identification miR-26a as a direct regulator of PTEN expression. We also show that miR-26a is frequently amplified at the DNA level in human glioma, most often in association with monoallelic PTEN loss. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-26a-mediated PTEN repression in a murine glioma model both enhances de novo tumor formation and precludes loss of heterozygosity and the PTEN locus. Our results document a new epigenetic mechanism for PTEN regulation in glioma and further highlight dysregulation of Akt signaling as crucial to the development of these tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;19498445&#9;miR-15a and miR-16-1 in cancer: discovery, function and future perspectives.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by the miR-15/16 cluster are known to act as tumor suppressors. Expression of these miRNAs inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis of cancer cells, and suppresses tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. miR-15a and miR-16-1 function by targeting multiple oncogenes, including BCL2, MCL1, CCND1, and WNT3A. Down-regulation of these miRNAs has been reported in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL), pituitary adenomas, and prostate carcinoma. This review summarizes the discovery, functions, and clinical relevance of these miRNAs in cancer, particularly CLL.&#9;&#9;&#9;19501075&#9;Microarray based analysis of microRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are very important regulators of biological processes such as development, cellular differentiation, and tumor generation. MiRNA microarray has been found to be a high throughput global analysis tool for detecting miRNA expression profiling, and miRNA expression profiling will facilitate the study of the biological function of miRNAs. In this report, we describe the miRNA expression level in rat cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury using microarray method. We choose several time points post brain injury: 6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively, to reveal differential expression of miRNAs in rat brain cortex compared with control groups. Our research revealed that 136 miRNAs were expressing at 6 h post injury, in which 13 miRNAs were more than 2-fold up-regulated, and 14 miRNAs were more than 2-fold down-regulated; 118 miRNAs were expressing at 24 h post injury, in which 4 miRNAs were more than 2-fold up-regulated, and 23 miRNAs were more than 2-fold down-regulated; 149 miRNAs were expressing at 48 h post injury, in which 16 miRNAs were more than 2-fold up-regulated, and 11 miRNAs were more than 2-fold down-regulated; and 203 miRNAs were expressing at 72 h post injury, in which 19 miRNAs were more than 2-fold up-regulated, and 5 miRNAs were more than 2-fold down-regulated. Furthermore, we revealed global up-regulation of miR-21 expression within all the four time points post injury. Finally, we utilized qRT-PCR methods to verify the microarray results. The qRT-PCR results indicated good consistency with the results of the microarray method. Our microarray based analysis of microRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury has shown that some microRNA such as miR-21 could be involved in the intricate process of TBI course.&#9;&#9;&#9;19536656&#9;microRNAs in CNS disorders.&#9;&#9;In recent years, there has been a shift in the conventional paradigms for transcriptional and translational regulation as extensive sequencing efforts have yielded new insights into the landscape of the human genome and transcriptome. Hundreds of non-coding regulatory RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and are reported to mediate pivotal roles in many aspects of neuronal functions. Disruption of miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation has been implicated in a range of CNS disorders as one miRNA is predicted to impact the expression of numerous downstream mRNA targets. The intricate molecular networks mediated by an miRNA form a robust mechanism for rapid and potent responses to cellular events throughout the development of the human brain. Recent studies have identified a molecular and ultimately pathogenic role for a subset of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, including the characterization of their downstream CNS mRNA targets, such as beta-secretase (BACE1) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we present an overview of the current progress in miRNA research related to CNS disorders and also highlight the utility of LNA (locked nucleic acid)-modified oligonucleotides in the detection and modulation of miRNA activity.&#9;&#9;&#9;19540598&#9;Characterization of an NF-kappaB-regulated, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of complement factor H (CFH) in metal-sulfate-stressed human brain cells.&#9;&#9;Micro RNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that are post-transcriptional regulators of messenger RNA (mRNA) complexity. Brain cells maintain distinct populations of miRNAs that support physiologically normal patterns of expression, however, certain miRNA abundances are significantly altered in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we provide evidence in human neural (HN) cells of an aluminum-sulfate- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a that down-regulates the expression of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of inflammation. This NF-kappaB-miRNA-146a-CFH signaling circuit is known to be similarly affected by Abeta42 peptides and in AD brain. These aluminum-sulfate-inducible events were not observed in parallel experiments using iron-, magnesium-, or zinc-sulfate-stressed HN cells. An NF-kappaB-containing miRNA-146a-promoter-luciferase reporter construct transfected into HN cells showed significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a after aluminum-sulfate treatment that corresponded to decreased CFH gene expression. These data suggest that (1) as in AD brain, NF-kappaB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated, modulation of CFH gene expression may contribute to inflammatory responses in aluminum-stressed HN cells, and (2) underscores the potential of nanomolar aluminum to drive genotoxic mechanisms characteristic of neurodegenerative disease processes.&#9;&#9;&#9;19566826&#9;MicroRNAs and apoptosis: implications in the molecular therapy of human disease.&#9;&#9;1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides, are now recognized as a very large family present throughout the genomes of plants and metazoans. These small transcripts modulate protein expression by binding to complementary or partially complementary target protein-coding mRNAs and targeting them for degradation or translational inhibition. 2. The discovery of miRNAs has revolutionized our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression, with the addition of an entirely novel level of regulatory control. Considerable information on miRNAs has been accumulated in this rapidly evolving research field. We now know that miRNAs play pivotal roles in diverse processes, such as development and differentiation, control of cell proliferation and death, stress response and metabolism. Indeed, aberrant miRNA expression has been documented in human disease as well as in animal models, with evidence for a causative role in tumourigenesis. 3. One of the most active fields of miRNA research is miRNA regulation of apoptosis, a programmed cell death implicated in many human diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, hypertrophy and heart failure. Thus far, nearly 30 of 500 human miRNAs have been validated experimentally to regulate apoptosis; this number is likely to increase with future studies. 4. The present review provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of the currently available data, focusing on the transcriptional controls, target genes and signalling pathways linking the apoptosis-regulating miRNAs and apoptotic cell death.&#9;&#9;&#9;19568434&#9;Evidence for X-chromosomal schizophrenia associated with microRNA alterations.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe disabling brain disease affecting about 1% of the population. Individual microRNAs (miRNAs) affect moderate downregulation of gene expression. In addition, components required for miRNA processing and/or function have also been implicated in X-linked mental retardation, neurological and neoplastic diseases, pointing to the wide ranging involvement of miRNAs in disease.&#9;METHODS AND FINDINGS: To explore the role of miRNAs in schizophrenia, 59 microRNA genes on the X-chromosome were amplified and sequenced in males with (193) and without (191) schizophrenia spectrum disorders to test the hypothesis that ultra-rare mutations in microRNA collectively contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. Here we provide the first association of microRNA gene dysfunction with schizophrenia. Eight ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified in eight distinct miRNA genes in 4% of analyzed males with schizophrenia. One ultra-rare variant was identified in a control sample (with a history of depression) (8/193 versus 1/191, p = 0.02 by one-sided Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 8.2). These variants were not found in an additional 7,197 control X-chromosomes.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Functional analyses of ectopically expressed copies of the variant miRNA precursors demonstrate loss of function, gain of function or altered expression levels. While confirmation is required, this study suggests that microRNA mutations can contribute to schizophrenia.&#9;&#9;&#9;19576215&#9;Altered microRNA expression following traumatic spinal cord injury.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs leading to their translational inhibition or sometimes degradation. We uncovered a previously unknown alteration in temporal expression of a large set of miRNAs following a contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats using microarray analysis. These altered miRNAs can be classified into 3 categories: (1) up-regulation, (2) down-regulation and (3) an early up-regulation at 4 h followed by down-regulation at 1 and 7 days post-SCI. The bioinformatics analysis indicates that the potential targets for miRNAs altered after SCI include genes encoding components that are involved in the inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis that are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of SCI. These findings suggest that abnormal expression of miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCI and are potential targets for therapeutic interventions following SCI.&#9;&#9;&#9;19580667&#9;Extraneural metastases from cranial meningioma: a case report.&#9;&#9;Extracranial metastases from brain meningiomas is a rare, but well-documented entity. Metastases occur mostly in the lungs, pleura and liver, but may also affect lymph nodes and bones. We report here on a patient who was treated for an atypical brain meningioma with multiple surgeries and multiple sessions of stereotactic radiosurgery with good control of his brain disease. Thirteen years after diagnosis, he developed bilateral large sacroiliac and abdominal metastases.&#9;&#9;&#9;19621023&#9;Responses of microRNAs 124a and 223 following spinal cord injury in mice.&#9;&#9;STUDY DESIGN: We investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice.&#9;OBJECTIVES: The recent discovery of miRNAs suggests a novel regulatory control over gene expression during plant and animal development. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that suppress the translation of target genes by binding to their mRNAs, and play a central role in gene regulation in health and disease. The purpose of this study was to examine miRNA expression after SCI.&#9;SETTING: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University.&#9;METHODS: We examined the expression of miRNA (miR)-223 and miR-124a in a mouse model at 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after SCI using quantitative PCR. The miRNA expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization.&#9;RESULTS: Quantitative PCR revealed two peaks of miR-223 expression at 6 and 12 h and 3 days after SCI. MiR-124a expression decreased significantly from 1 day to 7 days after SCI. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of miR-223 around the injured site. However, miR-124a, which was present in the normal spinal cord, was not observed at the injured site.&#9;CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a time-dependent expression pattern of miR-223 and miR-124a in a mouse model of SCI. In this study, the time course of miRNA-223 expression may be related to inflammatory responses after SCI, and the time course of decreased miR-124a expression may reflect cell death.&#9;&#9;&#9;19665999&#9;MicroRNA-205 inhibits tumor cell migration through down-regulating the expression of the LDL receptor-related protein 1.&#9;&#9;Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including tumor metastasis and Alzheimer's disease. However, mechanisms that regulate LRP1 expression under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are not unclear. In human cell lines, we found that miR-205 down-regulates the expression of LRP1 by targeting sequences in the 3'UTR of LRP1 mRNA. This effect was abolished by deleting the miR-205 seed site in the 3'UTR of LRP1. The ectopic expression of miR-205 also significantly mitigated migration of both U87 and SK-LU-1 cells. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that expression of human LRP1 is regulated in part by a specific miRNA, leading to decreased tumor cell migration.&#9;&#9;&#9;19668211&#9;Existence of a microRNA pathway in anucleate platelets.&#9;&#9;Platelets have a crucial role in the maintenance of hemostasis as well as in thrombosis and vessel occlusion, which underlie stroke and acute coronary syndromes. Anucleate platelets contain mRNAs and are capable of protein synthesis, raising the issue of how these mRNAs are regulated. Here we show that human platelets harbor an abundant and diverse array of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are known as key regulators of mRNA translation in other cell types. Further analyses revealed that platelets contain the Dicer and Argonaute 2 (Ago2) complexes, which function in the processing of exogenous miRNA precursors and the control of specific reporter transcripts, respectively. Detection of the receptor P2Y(12) mRNA in Ago2 immunoprecipitates suggests that P2Y(12) expression may be subjected to miRNA control in human platelets. Our study lends an additional level of complexity to the control of gene expression in these anucleate elements of the cardiovascular system.&#9;&#9;&#9;19670632&#9;[Trends in development of self-complementary adeno-associated virus vector].&#9;&#9;Numerous studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of recombinant adeno-associated virus gene delivery vectors. However, prior to expression, it is necessary to convert the single-stranded DNA genome into double-stranded DNA, which hinders the efficiency of these vectors. We can entirely circumvent this step through the use of self-complementary recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (scrAAV). ScrAAV packages an inverted repeat genome that can fold into double-stranded DNA without the requirement for DNA synthesis or base-pairing between multiple vector genomes. By using scrAAV, we could increase expression efficiency and reduce immune response caused by vectors themselves. Therefore, it is a promising vector for gene therapy. So far, it has been used in the treatment of hepatic diseases, central nervous system diseases, and eye diseases. It has also been used in the modifications of stem cells and as vectors for siRNA/miRNA and ribozymes. In this review, we focused on the preparation, expression and location of scrAAV both in vitro and in vivo. We mainly introduced the recent progress of scrAAV based therapy of Hemophilia B, in order to elucidate the potential and prospects of scrAAV in gene therapy.&#9;&#9;&#9;19679163&#9;Regulation of non-coding RNA networks in the nervous system--what's the REST of the story?&#9;&#9;Recent advances are now providing novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie how cellular complexity, diversity, and connectivity are encoded within the genome. The repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencing factor (REST/NRSF) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators that seem to orchestrate almost every aspect of nervous system development, homeostasis, and plasticity. REST and its primary cofactor, CoREST, dynamically recruit highly malleable macromolecular complexes to widely distributed genomic regulatory sequences, including the repressor element-1/neuron restrictive silencer element (RE1/NRSE). Through epigenetic mechanisms, such as site-specific targeting and higher-order chromatin remodeling, REST and CoREST can mediate cell type- and developmental stage-specific gene repression, gene activation, and long-term gene silencing for protein-coding genes and for several classes of ncRNAs (e.g. microRNAs [miRNAs] and long ncRNAs). In turn, these ncRNAs have similarly been implicated in the regulation of chromatin architecture and dynamics, transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and RNA editing and trafficking. In addition, REST and CoREST expression and function are tightly regulated by context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms including bidirectional feedback loops with various ncRNAs. Not surprisingly, deregulation of REST and ncRNAs are both implicated in the molecular pathophysiology underlying diverse disorders that range from brain cancer and stroke to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes emerging aspects of the complex mechanistic relationships between these intricately interlaced control systems for neural gene expression and function.&#9;&#9;&#9;19683563&#9;miR-34a, a microRNA up-regulated in a double transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, inhibits bcl2 translation.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding regulatory RNA molecules that modulate protein expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or promoting mRNA degradation. However, little is understood about the roles of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease. During a research for miRNAs that are differentially expressed in cerebral cortex of APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice (a model for Alzheimer's disease) and age-matched controls, one candidate miRNA that is relatively highly expressed, miR-34a, was studied further because sequence analysis suggested a likely interaction with the 3'-untranslated region of bcl2 mRNA. We show that the expression of miR-34a is inversely correlated with the protein level of bcl2 in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and age-matched controls, and miR-34a expression directly inhibits bcl2 translation in SH-SY5Y cells. No effect on bcl2 mRNA level was observed. Western blot analysis of active caspase-3 showed higher levels in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and stable transfecant cell line of miR-34a than in controls. Consistently, miR-34a knockdown through antisense LNA oligonucleotides increased the level of bcl2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, which was accompanied by a decrease of active caspase-3. These findings suggested that bcl2 is an important functional target for miR-34a, and the abnormal expression of miR-34a may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, at least in part by affecting the expression of bcl2.&#9;&#9;&#9;19703993&#9;Downregulated microRNA-200a in meningiomas promotes tumor growth by reducing E-cadherin and activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.&#9;&#9;Meningiomas, one of the most common human brain tumors, are derived from arachnoidal cells associated with brain meninges, are usually benign, and are frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. Here, we define a typical human meningioma microRNA (miRNA) profile and characterize the effects of one downregulated miRNA, miR-200a, on tumor growth. Elevated levels of miR-200a inhibited meningioma cell growth in culture and in a tumor model in vivo. Upregulation of miR-200a decreased the expression of transcription factors ZEB1 and SIP1, with consequent increased expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion protein associated with cell differentiation. Downregulation of miR-200a in meningiomas and arachnoidal cells resulted in increased expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 involved in cell proliferation. miR-200a was found to directly target beta-catenin mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation and blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which is frequently involved in cancer. A direct correlation was found between the downregulation of miR-200a and the upregulation of beta-catenin in human meningioma samples. Thus, miR-200a appears to act as a multifunctional tumor suppressor miRNA in meningiomas through effects on the E-cadherin and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. This reveals a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involved in meningioma tumor development and highlights a novel molecular interaction between miR-200a and Wnt signaling, thereby providing insights into novel therapies for meningiomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;19707536&#9;Searching for MIND: microRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases.&#9;&#9;In few years our understanding of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate gene expression, and the functional roles of miRNAs has been expanded. Interestingly, numerous miRNAs are expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled manner in the nervous system, suggesting that their posttrascriptional regulation may be particularly relevant in neural development and function. MiRNA studies in neurobiology showed their involvement in synaptic plasticity and brain diseases. In this review ,correlations between miRNA-mediated gene silencing and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. Molecular and cellular neurobiological studies of the miRNAs in neurodegeneration represent the exploration of a new Frontier of miRNAs biology and the potential development of new diagnostic tests and genetic therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.&#9;&#9;&#9;19712440&#9;Upregulation of miRNA hsa-miR-342-3p in experimental and idiopathic prion disease.&#9;&#9;ABSTRACT: The aim of our study was to analyze the differential expression of miRNAs in the brains of BSE-infected cynomolgus macaques as a model for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression by mRNA targeting. Among other functions they contribute to neuronal development and survival. Recently, the lack of miRNA processing has been shown to promote neurodegeneration and deregulation of several miRNAs has been reported to be associated with Scrapie in mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that miRNAs are also regulated in response to human prion disease. We have applied miRNA-microarrays to identify deregulated miRNA candidates in brains of BSE-infected macaques. Shock-frozen brain sections of six BSE-infected and five non-infected macaques were used to validate regulated miRNA candidates by two independent qRT-PCR-based methods. Our study revealed significant upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p and hsa-miR-494 in the brains of BSE-infected macaques compared to non-infected animals. In a pilot study we could show that hsa-miR-342-3p was also upregulated in brain samples of human type 1 and type 2 sporadic CJD. With respect to the reported regulation of this miRNA in Scrapie-infected mice, we propose that upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p may be a general phenomenon in late stage prion disease and might be used as a novel marker for animal and human TSEs.&#9;&#9;&#9;19724284&#9;Brain and blood microRNA expression profiling of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and kainate seizures.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and have a critical role in many biologic and pathologic processes. We hypothesized that miRNA expression profiles in injured brain (hippocampus) would show common as well as unique profiles when compared with those of blood. Adult, untouched, control rats were compared with rats with sham surgeries, ischemic strokes, brain hemorrhage (lysed blood, fresh blood, or thrombin), and kainate-induced seizures. Brain and whole-blood miRNA expression profiles were assessed 24 h later using TaqMan rodent miRNA arrays. MicroRNA response profiles were different for each condition. Many miRNAs changed more than 1.5-fold in brain and blood after each experimental manipulation, and several miRNAs were upregulated or downregulated in both brain and blood after a given injury. A few miRNAs (e.g., miR-298, miR-155, and miR-362-3p) were upregulated or downregulated more than twofold in both brain and blood after several different injuries. The results show the possible use of blood miRNAs as biomarkers for brain injury; that selected blood miRNAs may correlate with miRNA changes in the brain; and that many of the mRNAs, previously shown to be regulated in brain and blood after brain injury, are likely accounted for by changes in miRNA expression.&#9;&#9;&#9;19731102&#9;microRNAs in gliomas: small regulators of a big problem.&#9;&#9;Gliomas are the most common form of primary brain tumors and are associated with a poor clinical outcome. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to gliomagenesis have become increasingly clear in recent years, yet much remains to be learned. This is particularly true for the role of microRNAs in gliomagenesis, as an appreciation for the significance of aberrant miRNA expression in human cancer has only emerged in the last 5 years. It is now evident that microRNAs regulate a wide variety of tumorigenic processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and apoptosis. Here we review the current state of knowledge related to the role of microRNAs in glial tumor development. This is a rapidly evolving field and it is likely that we have only begun to appreciate the involvement of microRNAs in relation to glioma formation, and the therapeutic potential of microRNAs to improve outcome for glioma patients.&#9;&#9;&#9;19745058&#9;Plasma MicroRNAs as sensitive and specific biomarkers of tissue injury.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small noncoding RNAs. Because of their size, abundance, tissue specificity, and relative stability in plasma, miRNAs hold promise as unique accessible biomarkers to monitor tissue injury.&#9;METHODS: We investigated the use of liver-, muscle- and brain-specific miRNAs as circulating biomarkers of tissue injury. We used a highly sensitive quantitative PCR assay to measure specific miRNAs (miR-122, miR-133a, and miR-124) in plasma samples from rats treated with liver or muscle toxicants and from a rat surgical model of stroke.&#9;RESULTS: We observed increases in plasma concentrations of miR-122, miR-133a, and miR-124 corresponding to injuries in liver, muscle, and brain, respectively. miR-122 and miR-133a illustrated specificity for liver and muscle toxicity, respectively, because they were not detectable in the plasma of animals with toxicity to the other organ. This result contrasted with the results for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase, which were both increased with either organ toxicity. Furthermore, miR-122 exhibited a diagnostic sensitivity superior to that of ALT when the results were correlated to the liver histopathologic results. The miR-124 concentration increased in the plasma of rats 8 h after surgery to produce brain injury and peaked at 24 h, while the miR-122 and miR-133a concentrations remained at baseline values.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that tissue-specific miRNAs may serve as diagnostically sensitive plasma biomarkers of tissue injury.&#9;&#9;&#9;19763905&#9;The therapeutic potential of microRNAs in nervous system damage, degeneration, and repair.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAS (miRNAs) have been suggested to play important roles in the central nervous system during development as well as disease. miRNAs appear to be dysregulated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, developmental disorders, and as a result of stroke. Each miRNA has the ability to regulate hundreds of messenger RNA transcripts, both by causing degradation of the mRNA and by inhibition of protein translation. Recent findings suggest that it may eventually be possible to treat some neurological disorders by restoring or inhibiting miRNAs altered by disease pathology. Both viral delivery and administration of modified oligonucleotides mimicking or inhibiting specific miRNAs have been effective in model systems. Artificial miRNAs have also been generated for the repression of specific transcripts. Alteration of miRNA expression by disease and insult also holds the potential for improved diagnostic tools. Finally, miRNAs have been shown to control cellular proliferation and specification, suggesting that manipulation of miRNAs in cultured cells could result in more convenient generation of pure cell populations for transplantation.&#9;&#9;&#9;19801956&#9;HSV-1 infection of human brain cells induces miRNA-146a and Alzheimer-type inflammatory signaling.&#9;&#9;Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection of human brain cells induces changes in gene expression favorable to the propagation of the infecting agent and detrimental to the function of the host cells. We report that infection of human primary neural cells with a high phenotypic reactivator HSV-1 (17syn+) induces upregulation of a brain-enriched microRNA (miRNA)-146a that is associated with proinflammatory signaling in stressed brain cells and Alzheimer's disease. Expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2, and the neuroinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta were each upregulated. A known miRNA-146a target in the brain, complement factor H, was downregulated. These data suggest a role for HSV-1-induced miRNA-146a in the evasion of HSV-1 from the complement system, and the activation of key elements of the arachidonic acid cascade known to contribute to Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.&#9;&#9;&#9;19822222&#9;MicroRNAs: novel therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.&#9;&#9;The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is rising steadily as human life expectancy increases. However, limited knowledge of the molecular basis of disease pathogenesis is a major hurdle in the identification of drug targets and development of therapeutic strategies for these largely incurable disorders. Recently, differential expression of endogenous regulatory small RNAs, known as 'microRNAs' (miRNAs), in patients of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and models of ataxia suggest that they might have key regulatory roles in neurodegeneration. miRNAs that can target known mediators of neurodegeneration offer potential therapeutic targets. Our bioinformatic analysis suggests novel miRNA-target interactions that could potentially influence neurodegeneration. The recent development of molecules that alter miRNA expression promises valuable tools that will enhance the therapeutic potential of miRNAs.&#9;&#9;&#9;19831127&#9;Safety and yield of early cessation of AEDs in video-EEG telemetry and outcomes.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Video-electroencephalography (VEEG) telemetry is the simultaneous recording of ictal and interictal EEG pattern and paroxysmal behavior to investigate the nature of paroxysmal events.&#9;METHODS: This is a prospective study performed to asses the safety and yield of early discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the telemetry unit. Over a 2.5-year period, 50 patients that met the indications for VEEG monitoring were admitted by an epileptologist to neuro-observation units with continuous monitoring, nursing coverage and EEG technicians support during working hours and on-call thereafter. In most cases AEDs (except Phenobarbital) were discontinued in 24h. We prospectively assessed the yield and safety of the telemetry investigation as well as epilepsy surgery outcomes.&#9;RESULTS: Our monitoring answered the study question in 88% of the patients. The question was not answered in 12% of cases due to the lack of recorded events. Our results changed the management in 74% of cases and potentially improved quality of life by decreasing the AEDs consumption and number of seizures per month. Over all, 22% received epilepsy surgery and became either seizure free or their seizures became non-disabling. Our method significantly decreased the duration of hospital admission for monitoring and minimal complications occurred only in 8% of patients.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our method for short VEEG monitoring has a high yield for diagnosis, minimal complications and is cost effective. These qualities, together with good surgery results validate our method for the investigation and treatment of refractory seizure cases.&#9;&#9;&#9;19881909&#9;MicroRNA: Implications for Alzheimer Disease and other Human CNS Disorders.&#9;&#9;Understanding complex diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) has been a major challenge. Unlike the familial forms of AD, the genetic and environmental risks factors identified for sporadic AD are extensive. MicroRNAs are one of the major noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulators to silence or suppress gene expression via translational inhibition or message degradation. Their discovery has evoked great excitement in biomedical research for their promise as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Key microRNAs have been identified as essential for a variety of cellular events including cell lineage determination, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization; most, if not all, acting to fine-tune gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a host of cellular signaling networks. Dysfunctional microRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease states. Here, the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the central nervous system is reviewed with emphasis on their impact on the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD.&#9;&#9;&#9;19888324&#9;Expression profile of MicroRNAs in young stroke patients.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: The methods currently available for diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral ischaemia still require further improvements. Micro-RNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have been recently reported as useful biomarkers in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We therefore carried out microRNA (miRNA) profiling from peripheral blood to detect and identify characteristic patterns in ischaemic stroke.&#9;METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ischaemic stroke patients aged between 18-49 years, characterized based on World Health Organization clinical criteria were further classified according to TOAST classification, a) Large-vessel atherosclerosis [n=8] b) Small-vessel disease [n=3] c) Cardioembolism [n=5] d) Undetermined cause [n=3]. The patients' functional status at the time of blood sampling (at the outpatient clinics) was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Blood samples from normal (n=5) individuals were used as controls. Total RNA extracted from whole blood was subjected to miroRNA profiling and real-time PCR analysis. miRNAs that are implicated in the endothelial/vascular function, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and neural function showed differential expression profile as compared to the normal control. Interestingly, miRNAs that are involved in hypoxic conditions have also been found in our miRNA profiles.&#9;CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the peripheral blood miRNAs and their profiles can be developed as biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral ischaemic stroke. The dysregulated miRNAs have been detectable even after several months from the onset of stroke in what is usually regarded as neurologically stable patients.&#9;&#9;&#9;19901543&#9;Normal and oncogenic roles for microRNAs in the developing brain.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAS (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that play important roles in many different biological processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis through silencing of target genes. Emerging evidence indicates that miRNAs are key players in mammalian development that, when altered, contribute to tumorigenesis. However, only a few studies to date have focused on the role of miRNAs in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. These tumors arise in the cerebellum and may attribute their origins to deregulated proliferation of neural progenitor cells during development. Understanding the interplay between normal brain development and medulloblastoma pathogenesis is necessary in order for more efficient, less toxic targeted therapies to be developed and implemented. MiRNA expression profiling of both mouse and human medulloblastomas has led to the identification of signatures correlating with the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, tumor diagnosis and response to treatment, as well as novel targets of potential clinical relevance. This review summarizes the recent miRNA literature in both medulloblastoma and normal brain development.&#9;&#9;&#9;19909260&#9;Transcriptional dysregulation of coding and non-coding genes in cellular models of Huntington's disease.&#9;&#9;HD (Huntington's disease) is a late onset heritable neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and death, particularly in the cerebral cortex and medium spiny neurons of the striatum. This is followed by progressive chorea, dementia and emotional dysfunction, eventually resulting in death. HD is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the first exon of the HD gene that results in an abnormally elongated polyQ (polyglutamine) tract in its protein product, Htt (Huntingtin). Wild-type Htt is largely cytoplasmic; however, in HD, proteolytic N-terminal fragments of Htt form insoluble deposits in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, provoking the idea that mutHtt (mutant Htt) causes transcriptional dysfunction. While a number of specific transcription factors and co-factors have been proposed as mediators of mutHtt toxicity, the causal relationship between these Htt/transcription factor interactions and HD pathology remains unknown. Previous work has highlighted REST [RE1 (repressor element 1)-silencing transcription factor] as one such transcription factor. REST is a master regulator of neuronal genes, repressing their expression. Many of its direct target genes are known or suspected to have a role in HD pathogenesis, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Recent evidence has also shown that REST regulates transcription of regulatory miRNAs (microRNAs), many of which are known to regulate neuronal gene expression and are dysregulated in HD. Thus repression of miRNAs constitutes a second, indirect mechanism by which REST can alter the neuronal transcriptome in HD. We will describe the evidence that disruption to the REST regulon brought about by a loss of interaction between REST and mutHtt may be a key contributory factor in the widespread dysregulation of gene expression in HD.&#9;&#9;&#9;19911064&#9;Interaction map and selection of microRNA targets in Parkinson's disease-related genes.&#9;&#9;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multigenic neurodisorder frequently occurring in elderly persons. To investigate noncoding tiny microRNA mediated gene regulation, miRanda (version 1.0b) was used to predict human miRNA target sites on selected 29 genes related to PD. To verify output generated from miRanda, a similar analysis was performed only for microRNA target sites in 3'UTR using TargetScan (version 5.1). Data extracted by miRanda elucidates the mode of microRNA action based on the location of target sites in the Parkinson genes. Sites prone to action of multiple miRNAs were identified as &quot;hot spots.&quot; Important properties of each miRNA including multiplicity and cooperativity appear to contribute towards a complex interplay between miRNAs and their targets. Two sets of predicted results were explored for the occurrence of target sites of 112 miRNAs expressed in midbrain. Overall, convergence of results predicted by two algorithms revealed that 48 target sites for midbrain-specific miRNA occur in close proximity in 9 genes. This study will pave a way for selection of potential miRNA candidates for Parkinson's disease-related genes for quick therapeutic applications and diagnosis.&#9;&#9;&#9;19934272&#9;The modulation of microRNAs by type I IFN through the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 in human glioma.&#9;&#9;Type I IFNs are involved in double-stranded RNA responses. Here, we investigated the possibility that IFN-beta may induce or downregulate cellular microRNAs (miRNA) in human neoplasms and thereby use the RNA interference system to show antitumor effects. Because of its known connection to glioma biology, we focused on miR-21 among seven miRNAs influenced by IFN-beta. We analyzed the effect of IFN-beta treatment on miR-21 expression in glioma cells and intracranial glioma xenografts. IFN-beta treatment reduced miR-21 expression in glioma cells markedly, and IFN-beta administration suppressed the growth of glioma-initiating cell-derived intracranial tumors. The levels of primary miR-21 gene transcripts, precursor miR-21, and mature miR-21 decreased 6 hours after the addition of IFN-beta, indicating that the reduction in miR-21 levels was due to transcriptional suppression. We did reporter assays to elucidate the IFN-beta-mediated suppression of miR-21; the addition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-expressing vectors induced the IFN-beta-mediated suppression of miR-21, whereas STAT3-inhibiting agents inhibited the miR-21 suppression. Thus, the results of our study show that the downregulation of miR-21 contributes to the antitumor effects of IFN-beta and that miR-21 expression is negatively regulated by STAT3 activation. These results highlight the importance of understanding the transcriptional regulation of the miRNAs involved in oncogenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;19936094&#9;MicroRNA expression in Alzheimer blood mononuclear cells.&#9;&#9;Various coding genes representing multiple functional categories are downregulated in blood mononuclear cells (BMC) of patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Noncoding microRNAs (miRNA) regulate gene expression by degrading messages or inhibiting translation. Using BMC as a paradigm for the study of systemic alterations in AD, we investigated whether peripheral miRNA expression is altered in this condition. MicroRNA levels were assessed using the microRNA microarray (MMChip) containing 462 human miRNA, and the results validated by real time PCR. Sixteen AD patients and sixteen normal elderly controls (NEC) were matched for ethnicity, age, gender and education. The expression of several BMC miRNAs was found to increase in AD relative to NEC levels, and may differ between AD subjects bearing one or two APOE4 alleles. As compared to NEC, miRNAs significantly upregulated in AD subjects and confirmed by qPCR were miR-34a and 181b. Predicted target genes downregulated in Alzheimer BMC that correlated with the upregulated miRNAs were largely represented in the functional categories of Transcription/Translation and Synaptic Activity. Several miRNAs targeting the same genes were within the functional category of Injury response/Redox homeostasis. Taken together, induction of microRNA expression in BMC may contribute to the aberrant systemic decline in mRNA levels in sporadic AD.&#9;&#9;&#9;20004148&#9;Evaluation of sleep quality in patients with refractory seizures who undergo epilepsy surgery.&#9;&#9;The aim of the study was to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness and subjective sleep quality in patients who undergo epilepsy surgery for treatment of refractory partial seizures. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in this research study. All of them were evaluated 2 days before and 3 months after the surgery. Two questionnaires were used to assess daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). Global PSQI was high (mean=5.65 SD=3.71) before the surgical procedure (P&lt;0.001). PSQI evaluation revealed higher and statistically significant scores in three components as well as in the global score, when analyzed by predominance of daytime or nocturnal seizures. ESS and PSQI scores were also analyzed by gender, antiepileptic drug class, age, and seizure frequency, with no significant differences. We concluded that patients with partial recurrent seizures of temporal origin have poor subjective sleep quality that improves significantly after epilepsy surgery.&#9;&#9;&#9;20043718&#9;The many roles of microRNAs in brain tumor biology.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as the primary RNAs involved in the purposeful silencing of the cell's own message. In addition to the established role of miRNAs as developmental regulators of normal cellular function, they have recently been shown to be important players in pathological states such as cancer. The authors review the literature on the role of miRNAs in the formation and propagation of gliomas and medulloblastomas, highlighting the potential of these molecules and their inhibitors as therapeutics.&#9;&#9;&#9;20072941&#9;Novel functions for small RNA molecules.&#9;&#9;Small RNAs are short (approximately 18 to 30 nucleotides), non-coding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus via post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), chromatin-dependent gene silencing (CDGS) or RNA activation (RNAa). Three classes of small RNAs have been defined: microRNAs (miRNAs), siRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Research has indicated that small RNAs play important roles in cellular processes such as cell differentiation, growth/proliferation, migration, apoptosis/death, metabolism and defense. Accordingly, small RNAs are critical regulators of normal development and physiology. More interestingly, increasing evidence indicates that small RNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease and infectious disease. More than 20 clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate therapies based on small RNA. Additionally, small RNAs may serve as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the majority of diseases.&#9;&#9;&#9;20088716&#9;More insight into mesenchymal stem cells and their effects inside the body.&#9;&#9;IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The pan-tissue existence and multipotency of differentiation make mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an attractive source of cells as tissue repair cells, seeds of engineered tissue, vehicles for gene therapy or in combination to promote tissue regeneration in wound healing and disease recovery.&#9;AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review focuses on recent understanding on MSC's basic biological characteristics and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSCs in vivo.&#9;WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The gene expression profiles for mRNA, protein, microRNA and cell surface marker of MSCs are summarized. Special attention is given to miRNA expression and its relationship with the characteristics of MSCs. The mechanisms of therapeutic effects of MSCs are attributed to their ability to migrate along chemokine gradients, differentiate into tissue-specific cells, enhance angiogenesis of wound tissue and regulate immune response. As examples, a detailed description is given on the regeneration of functional sweat glands on burned skin as well as neural cells in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animals upon MSC transplantation.&#9;TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Based on current data, although limited, the mesenchymal-epithelial transition is proposed to be one of the important ways for MSCs to participate tissue repair.&#9;&#9;&#9;20091141&#9;Global microRNA expression profiling of Caenorhabditis elegans Parkinson's disease models.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in human brain development and maintenance. To search for miRNAs that may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD), we utilized miRNA microarrays to identify potential gene expression changes in 115 annotated miRNAs in PD-associated Caenorhabditis elegans models that either overexpress human A53T alpha-synuclein or have mutations within the vesicular catecholamine transporter (cat-1) or parkin (pdr-1) ortholog. Here, we show that 12 specific miRNAs are differentially regulated in the animals overexpressing alpha-synuclein, five in cat-1, and three in the pdr-1 mutants. The family of miR-64 and miR-65 are co-underexpressed in the alpha-synuclein transgenic and cat-1 strains, and members of let-7 family co-underexpressed in the alpha-synuclein and pdr-1 strains; mdl-1 and ptc-1 genes are target candidates for miR-64 and miR-65 and are overexpressed in alpha-synuclein transgenic as well as miR-64/65 (tm3711) knockout animals. These results indicate that miRNAs are differentially expressed in C. elegans PD models and suggest a role for these molecules in disease pathogenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;20097875&#9;MicroRNA profiling reveals new aspects of HIV neurodegeneration: caspase-6 regulates astrocyte survival.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules, which are known to regulate gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions. miRNA profiling was performed using brain tissue from patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuroinflammatory/degenerative disorder caused by HIV infection of the brain. Microarray analysis showed differential expression of multiple miRNAs in HIVE compared to control brains. Target prediction and gene ontology enrichment analysis disclosed targeting of several gene families/biological processes by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), with cell death-related genes, including caspase-6, showing a bias toward down-regulated DEMs. Consistent with the miRNA data, HIVE brains exhibited higher levels of caspase-6 transcripts compared with control patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of the cleaved form of caspase-6 in astrocytes in HIVE brain sections. Exposure of cultured human primary astrocytes to HIV viral protein R (Vpr) induced p53 up-regulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-6 activation followed by cell injury. Transgenic mice, expressing Vpr in microglial cells, demonstrated astrocyte apoptosis in brain, which was associated with caspase-6 activation and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Overall, these data point to previously unrecognized alterations in miRNA profile in the brain during HIV infection, which contribute to cell death through dysregulation of cell death machinery.&#9;&#9;&#9;20125089&#9;Novel animal models for studying complex brain disorders: BAC-driven miRNA-mediated in vivo silencing of gene expression.&#9;&#9;In schizophrenia, glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) disturbances are robust, consistently observed, cell-type specific and represent a core feature of the disease. In addition, neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is a phenotypic marker of a sub-population of GAD1-containing interneurons, has shown reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex in subjects with schizophrenia, suggesting that dysfunction of the NPY+ cortical interneuronal sub-population might be a core feature of this devastating disorder. However, modeling gene expression disturbances in schizophrenia in a cell type-specific manner has been extremely challenging. To more closely mimic these molecular and cellular human post-mortem findings, we generated a transgenic mouse in which we downregulated GAD1 mRNA expression specifically in NPY+ neurons. This novel, cell type-specific in vivo system for reducing gene expression uses a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the NPY promoter-enhancer elements, the reporter molecule (eGFP) and a modified intron containing a synthetic microRNA (miRNA) targeted to GAD1. The animals of isogenic strains are generated rapidly, providing a new tool for better understanding the molecular disturbances in the GABAergic system observed in complex neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. In the future, because of the small size of the silencing miRNAs combined with our BAC strategy, this method may be modified to allow generation of mice with simultaneous silencing of multiple genes in the same cells with a single construct, and production of splice-variant-specific knockdown animals.&#9;&#9;&#9;20126538&#9;Joint genome-wide profiling of miRNA and mRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease cortex reveals altered miRNA regulation.&#9;&#9;Although microRNAs are being extensively studied for their involvement in cancer and development, little is known about their roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used microarrays for the first joint profiling and analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs expression in brain cortex from AD and age-matched control subjects. These data provided the unique opportunity to study the relationship between miRNA and mRNA expression in normal and AD brains. Using a non-parametric analysis, we showed that the levels of many miRNAs can be either positively or negatively correlated with those of their target mRNAs. Comparative analysis with independent cancer datasets showed that such miRNA-mRNA expression correlations are not static, but rather context-dependent. Subsequently, we identified a large set of miRNA-mRNA associations that are changed in AD versus control, highlighting AD-specific changes in the miRNA regulatory system. Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between the levels of miRNAs and those of their targets in the brain. This has implications in the study of the molecular pathology of AD, as well as miRNA biology in general.&#9;&#9;&#9;20130213&#9;MicroRNA regulation of IFN-beta protein expression: rapid and sensitive modulation of the innate immune response.&#9;&#9;IFN-beta production is an inaugural event in the innate immune response to viral infections, with relatively small fold changes in IFN-beta expression resulting in the activation of important antiviral signaling cascades. In our rapid SIV/macaque model of HIV encephalitis, the virus enters the CNS within 4 d of infection, accompanied by a marked IFN-beta response that wanes as SIV replication is controlled. The centrality of IFN-beta to the innate antiviral response in the CNS combines with the potential inflammatory damage associated with long-term activation of this pathway to suggest that IFN-beta may be subject to regulatory fine-tuning in addition to well-established transcriptional and message stability mechanisms of regulation. In this paper, we present for the first time evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-26a, -34a, -145, and let-7b, may directly regulate IFN-beta in human and macaque cells. In primary primate macrophages, the main cell type implicated in HIV and SIV infection in the CNS, specific miRNAs reduce, whereas miRNA inhibitors enhance, IFN-beta protein production. The potential biologic significance of this regulation is supported by evidence of an apparent negative feedback loop, with increased expression of three IFN-beta-regulating miRNAs by primate macrophages exposed to recombinant IFN-beta or stimulated to produce IFN-beta. Thus, miRNAs may contribute significantly to the regulation of IFN-beta in innate immune responses.&#9;&#9;&#9;20145152&#9;miR-181a and miR-630 regulate cisplatin-induced cancer cell death.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNA) are noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. We used microarray technology to identify miRNAs that were upregulated by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in response to cisplatin (CDDP). The corresponding synthetic miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) per se were not lethal when transfected into A549 cells yet affected cell death induction by CDDP, C2-ceramide, cadmium, etoposide, and mitoxantrone in an inducer-specific fashion. Whereas synthetic miRNA inhibitors (anti-miRNAs) targeting miR-181a and miR-630 failed to modulate the response of A549 to CDDP, pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 enhanced and reduced CDDP-triggered cell death, respectively. Pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 consistently modulated mitochondrial/postmitochondrial steps of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, including Bax oligomerization, mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, and the proteolytic maturation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition, pre-miR-630 blocked early manifestations of the DNA damage response, including the phosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and of two ATM substrates, histone H2AX and p53. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of p53 corroborated the hypothesis that pre-miR-630 (but not pre-miR-181a) blocks the upstream signaling pathways that are ignited by DNA damage and converge on p53 activation. Pre-miR-630 arrested A549 cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, correlating with increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) as well as with reduced proliferation rates and resulting in greatly diminished sensitivity of A549 cells to the late S-G2-M cell cycle arrest mediated by CDDP. Altogether, these results identify miR-181a and miR-630 as novel modulators of the CDDP response in NSCLC.&#9;&#9;&#9;20156358&#9;A novel microRNA and transcription factor mediated regulatory network in schizophrenia.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a complex brain disorder with molecular mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that changes in gene expression may play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and that microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) are primary regulators of this gene expression. So far, several miRNA-TF mediated regulatory modules have been verified. We hypothesized that miRNAs and TFs might play combinatory regulatory roles for schizophrenia genes and, thus, explored miRNA-TF regulatory networks in schizophrenia.&#9;RESULTS: We identified 32 feed-forward loops (FFLs) among our compiled schizophrenia-related miRNAs, TFs and genes. Our evaluation revealed that these observed FFLs were significantly enriched in schizophrenia genes. By converging the FFLs and mutual feedback loops, we constructed a novel miRNA-TF regulatory network for schizophrenia. Our analysis revealed EGR3 and hsa-miR-195 were core regulators in this regulatory network. We next proposed a model highlighting EGR3 and miRNAs involved in signaling pathways and regulatory networks in the nervous system. Finally, we suggested several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on miRNAs, their target sites, and TFBSs, which may have an effect in schizophrenia gene regulation.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: This study provides many insights on the regulatory mechanisms of genes involved in schizophrenia. It represents the first investigation of a miRNA-TF regulatory network for a complex disease, as demonstrated in schizophrenia.&#9;&#9;&#9;20202123&#9;Aberrant microRNA expression in the brains of neurodegenerative diseases: miR-29a decreased in Alzheimer disease brains targets neurone navigator 3.&#9;&#9;AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translational repression of target mRNAs. Accumulating evidence indicates that various miRNAs, expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled that manner in the brain plays a key role in neuronal development. However, at present, the pathological implication of aberrant miRNA expression in neurodegenerative events remains largely unknown. To identify miRNAs closely associated with neurodegeneration, we performed miRNA expression profiling of brain tissues of various neurodegenerative diseases.&#9;METHODS: We initially studied the frontal cortex derived from three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients by using a microarray of 723 human miRNAs. This was followed by enlargement of study population with quantitative RT-PCR analysis (n = 21).&#9;RESULTS: By microarray analysis, we identified up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-338-3p in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains, but due to a great interindividual variation, we could not validate these results by quantitative RT-PCR. However, we found significant down-regulation of miR-29a in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The database search on TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase Target identified neurone navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a principal target of miR-29a, and actually NAV3 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains. MiR-29a-mediated down-regulation of NAV3 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. By immunohistochemistry, NAV3 expression was most evidently enhanced in degenerating pyramidal neurones in the cerebral cortex of AD.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest the hypothesis that underexpression of miR-29a affects neurodegenerative processes by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.&#9;&#9;&#9;20204141&#9;MicroRNA in Situ Hybridization in the Human Entorhinal and Transentorhinal Cortex.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in gene expression regulation in both healthy and disease brains. To better understand those roles, it is necessary to characterize the miRNAs that are expressed in particular cell types under a range of conditions. In situ hybridization (ISH) can demonstrate cell- and lamina-specific patterns of miRNA expression that would be lost in tissue-level expression profiling. In the present study, ISH was performed with special focus on the human entorhinal cortex (EC) and transentorhinal cortex (TEC). The TEC is the area of the cerebral cortex that first develops neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the reason for TEC's special vulnerability to AD-type pathology is unknown. MiRNA ISH was performed on three human brains with well-characterized clinical and pathological parameters. Locked nucleic acid ISH probes were used referent to miR-107, miR-124, miR-125b, and miR-320. In order to correlate the ISH data with AD pathology, the ISH staining was compared with near-adjacent slides processed using Thioflavine stains. Not all neurons or cortical lamina stain with equal intensity for individual miRNAs. As with other areas of brain, the TEC and EC have characteristic miRNA expression patterns. MiRNA ISH is among the first methods to show special staining characteristics of cells and laminae of the human TEC.&#9;&#9;&#9;20214679&#9;Expression pattern of miR-146a, an inflammation-associated microRNA, in experimental and human temporal lobe epilepsy.&#9;&#9;Increasing evidence supports the involvement of inflammatory and immune processes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). MicroRNAs (miRNA) represent small regulatory RNA molecules that have been shown to act as negative regulators of gene expression controlling different biological processes, including immune-system homeostasis and function. We investigated the expression and cellular distribution of miRNA-146a (miR-146a) in a rat model of TLE as well as in human TLE. miR-146a analysis in rat hippocampus was performed by polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry at 1 week and 3-4 months after induction of status epilepticus (SE). Prominent upregulation of miR-146a activation was evident at 1 week after SE and persisted in the chronic phase. The miR-146a expression was confirmed to be present in reactive astrocytes. In human TLE with hippocampal sclerosis, increased astroglial expression of miR-146a was observed mainly in regions where neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis occurred. The increased and persistent expression of miR-146a in reactive astrocytes supports the possible involvement of miRNAs in the modulation of the astroglial inflammatory response occurring in TLE and provides a target for future studies aimed at developing strategies against pro-epileptogenic inflammatory signalling.&#9;&#9;&#9;20219352&#9;The use of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-181b and hsa-miR-106a as prognostic indicators of astrocytoma.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with a variety of diseases including cancers. In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults.&#9;METHODS: We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR. The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples. The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.&#9;RESULTS: After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues. The down-regulation of hsa-miR-137 in astrocytomas was shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages of this disease. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis we showed that low expression of hsa-miR-181b or hsa-miR-106a, or high expression of hsa-miR-21 was significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a great potential for the use of miRNA profiling as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in defining the signature of astrocytomas and in predicting the post-surgical outcome.&#9;&#9;&#9;20228028&#9;[Seroprevalence of HTLV-1/2 in blood donors from Misiones Province].&#9;&#9;Human T-cell Lymphotropic viruses type 1 (HTLV-1), the first human oncoretrovirus to be discovered, is the etiologic agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 Associated Mielopathy or Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is endemic worldwide, including the North of Argentina where both associated diseases have also been detected. No etiologic role has been described for HTLV-2, although it has been associated with HAM/TSP-like neurologic syndromes. Both retroviruses are endemic in native populations of The Americas, Africa and at-risk populations. They are transmitted through sex contact, parenterally and from mother to child. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of HTLV-1/2 in a blood donor population from Misiones province. A total of 6912 accepted blood donations in 2008 were analyzed. HTLV-1/2 screening was performed with ELISA and particle agglutination, and reactive samples were confirmed by Western Blot. From the total, 5 samples resulted seropositive with a final prevalence of 0.00072. Out of the 5 positive samples, one was an HTLV, three HTLV-1 and one HTLV-2. These blood donors were residents of Posadas, Eldorado and Oberá, with no risk antecedents. This study demonstrates the presence of HTLV-1/2 in a population of Misiones with a prevalence rate similar to those reported among blood donors from non-endemic areas.&#9;&#9;&#9;20347722&#9;MicroRNAs as a molecular basis for mental retardation, Alzheimer's and prion diseases.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, approximately 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) non-coding RNA species that act as key regulators of gene expression along a central and well-defined cellular process known as RNA silencing, and involving the recognition and translational control of specific messenger RNA (mRNAs). Generated through the well-orchestrated and sequential processing of miRNA precursor molecules, mature miRNAs are subsequently incorporated into miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein effector complexes to regulate mRNA translation through the recognition of specific binding sites of imperfect complementarity located mainly in the 3' untranslated region. Predicted to regulate up to 90% of the genes in humans, miRNAs may thus control cellular processes in all cells and tissues of the human body. Likely to play a central role in health and disease, a dysfunctional miRNA-based regulation of gene expression may represent the main etiologic factor underlying diseases affecting major organs, such as the brain. In this review article, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role and function of miRNAs in the regulation of genes involved in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed, with a focus on the fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;20347935&#9;Micro RNA-125b (miRNA-125b) function in astrogliosis and glial cell proliferation.&#9;&#9;Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression that regulate the stability and translation of their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we report that the levels of a human brain-enriched miRNA-125b are up-regulated in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-stressed normal human astrocytes (NHA), a treatment known to induce astrogliosis. In vitro, anti-miRNA-125b added exogenously to IL-6-stressed NHA cultures attenuated both glial cell proliferation and increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), a miRNA-125b target and negative regulator of cell growth. A strong positive correlation between miRNA-125b abundance and the glial cell markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, and CDKN2A down-regulation was noted in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in Down's syndrome (DS) brain, chronic neurological disorders associated with astrogliosis. The results suggest that miRNA-125b up-regulation contributes to astrogliosis and to defects in the cell cycle that are characteristic of degenerating brain tissues.&#9;&#9;&#9;20375468&#9;Interpretation and applicability of microRNA data to the context of Alzheimer's and age-related diseases.&#9;&#9;Generated by the ribonuclease III Dicer, microRNAs (miRNAs) are predicted to regulate up to 90% of the genes in humans, suggesting that they may control every cellular processes in all cells and tissues of the human body! Likely to play a central role in health and disease, a dysfunctional miRNA-based regulation of gene expression may represent the main etiologic factor underlying age-related diseases affecting major organs, such as the brain. Here, we discuss some of the limitations associated to the interpretation and applicability of miRNA data, based on our recent study on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using transiently transfected murine neuronal N2a cells in culture, in parallel to a mouse model of AD, we were able to demonstrate a role for two miRNAs (miR-298 and miR-328) in the regulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP)-converting enzyme (BACE) messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, thereby providing key insights into the molecular basis underlying BACE deregulation in AD. However, whether miRNA data can be extrapolated and transposed to the human context of age-related diseases, such as AD, not only requires caution, but also warrants several considerations.&#9;&#9;&#9;20413881&#9;MiR-107 is reduced in Alzheimer's disease brain neocortex: validation study.&#9;&#9;MiR-107 is a microRNA (miRNA) that we reported previously to have decreased expression in the temporal cortical gray matter early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we study a new group of well-characterized human temporal cortex samples (N=19). MiR-107 expression was assessed, normalized to miR-124 and let-7a. Correlation was observed between decreased miR-107 expression and increased neuritic plaque counts (P&lt; 0.05) and neurofibrillary tangle counts (P&lt; 0.02) in adjacent brain tissue. Adjusted miR-107 and BACE1 mRNA levels tended to correlate negatively (trend with regression P&lt; 0.07). In sum, miR-107 expression tends to be lower relative to other miRNAs as AD progresses.&#9;&#9;&#9;20423304&#9;Neurogenesis: role for microRNAs and mesenchymal stem cells in pathological states.&#9;&#9;Implantation of adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat neural disorders shows promise. Depending on their microenvironment, MSCs could potentially be used for the repair and/or replacement of neurons in traumatic brain injury or the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This cross-disciplinary review incorporates aspects of neuroscience, stem cell biology, cancer biology and immunology to discuss interactions between inflammatory mediators and MSCs. We first discuss the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurological development. Secondly, we discuss the ability of MSCs to transdifferentiate into functional neurons, which are regulated by miRNAs, and the implications of these cells for the therapy of neuropathological states. The administration of effective and safe MSC therapy must acknowledge immune mediators that may predispose the early differentiating MSCs to oncogenic insults. Thus, we discuss a key gene, RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), based on its dual role in neurogenesis and cancer development. Immune mediators could be central to MSC responses within a region of tissue injury and are also discussed in detail. Exploring the predisposition of MSCs to oncogenesis is critical for translational science since the implementation of safeguarding measures prior to therapy can lead to the successful delivery of stem cells to patients. The method by which MSCs could be applied for future therapies might require trans-disciplinary approaches for personalized treatments.&#9;&#9;&#9;20423455&#9;Nuclear factor TDP-43 can affect selected microRNA levels.&#9;&#9;TDP-43 has recently been described as the major component of the inclusions found in the brain of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 is a ubiquitous protein whose specific functions are probably crucial to establishing its pathogenic role. Apart from its involvement in transcription, splicing and mRNA stability, TDP-43 has also been described as a Drosha-associated protein. However, our knowledge of the role of TDP-43 in the microRNA (miRNA) synthesis pathway is limited to the association mentioned above. Here we report for the first time which changes occur in the total miRNA population following TDP-43 knockdown in culture cells. In particular, we have observed that let-7b and miR-663 expression levels are down- and upregulated, respectively. Interestingly, both miRNAs are capable of binding directly to TDP-43 in different positions: within the miRNA sequence itself (let-7b) or in the hairpin precursor (miR-663). Using microarray data and real-time PCR we have also identified several candidate transcripts whose expression levels are selectively affected by these TDP-43-miRNA interactions.&#9;&#9;&#9;20451497&#9;Altered microRNAs in STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells: miR-146a targets TBP.&#9;&#9;We studied expression of 90 miRNAs in STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells, a model for Huntington's disease and compared with that obtained in STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) cells. Fifteen miRNAs were down regulated and 12 miRNAs were up regulated more than 2-fold. Such changes were statistically significant. One hundred and forty-two genes are experimentally known targets of these altered miRNAs. It has been predicted that miR-146a may target Tata Binding Protein (TBP). Using luciferase reporter assays with 3'-UTRs of TBP, over-expression and inhibition of miR-146a, we showed that miR-146a targets TBP. Regulation of TBP by miR-146a may contribute to HD pathogenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;20463920&#9;MicroRNA expression profiling of oligodendrocyte differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Cells of the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage play a vital role in the production and maintenance of myelin, a multilamellar membrane which allows for saltatory conduction along axons. These cells may provide immense therapeutic potential for lost sensory and motor function in demyelinating conditions, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling OL differentiation are largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered the &quot;micromanagers&quot; of gene expression with suggestive roles in cellular differentiation and maintenance. Although unique patterns of miRNA expression in various cell lineages have been characterized, this is the first report documenting their expression during oligodendrocyte maturation from human embryonic stem (hES) cells. Here, we performed a global miRNA analysis to reveal and identify characteristic patterns in the multiple stages leading to OL maturation from hES cells including those targeting factors involved in myelin production.&#9;METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We isolated cells from 8 stages of OL differentiation. Total RNA was subjected to miRNA profiling and validations preformed using real-time qRT-PCR. A comparison of miRNAs from our cultured OLs and OL progenitors showed significant similarities with published results from equivalent cells found in the rat and mouse central nervous system. Principal component analysis revealed four main clusters of miRNA expression corresponding to early, mid, and late progenitors, and mature OLs. These results were supported by correlation analyses between adjacent stages. Interestingly, the highest differentially-expressed miRNAs demonstrated a similar pattern of expression throughout all stages of differentiation, suggesting that they potentially regulate a common target or set of targets in this process. The predicted targets of these miRNAs include those with known or suspected roles in oligodendrocyte development and myelination including C11Orf9, CLDN11, MYTL1, MBOP, MPZL2, and DDR1.&#9;CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate miRNA profiles during distinct stages in oligodendroglial differentiation that may provide key markers of OL maturation. Our results reveal pronounced trends in miRNA expression and their potential mRNA target interactions that could provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of differentiation.&#9;&#9;&#9;20488792&#9;Multiple mechanisms downstream of TLR-4 stimulation allow expression of NKG2D ligands to facilitate macrophage/NK cell crosstalk.&#9;&#9;The activating receptor NKG2D recognizes proteins that are not normally expressed at the surface of most cells but are expressed during a cellular &quot;stress&quot; response (e.g., upon induction of the DNA damage pathway). This establishes recognition of &quot;induced self&quot; as an important strategy for surveillance of infections or tumor transformation. However, NKG2D ligands can also be induced on human macrophages by TLR stimulation, which has been far less studied. In this paper, we clarify that LPS, which ligates TLR-4, preferentially upregulated MICA and not MICB; CL097, which ligates TLR-7/8, upregulated both MICA and MICB; and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, which ligates TLR-3, upregulated neither. To probe how LPS stimulation triggers MICA expression, we determined that the stability of MICA mRNA was much longer than that of MICB mRNA, but neither was changed by LPS stimulation. This finding suggests that increased levels of MICA mRNA following LPS stimulation resulted from increased transcription. However, it was not sufficient for surface protein expression, which was controlled posttranscriptionally via a separate pathway involving the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinases. Moreover, LPS stimulation decreased expression of microRNAs (miRNA)--miR-17-5, miR-20a, and miR-93--which target MICA, implicating a novel role for miRNAs in NKG2D ligand expression. Thus, TLR stimulation allows expression of NKG2D ligands through multiple pathways, including downmodulation of specific miRNAs.&#9;&#9;&#9;20507594&#9;Evidence for natural antisense transcript-mediated inhibition of microRNA function.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate diverse sets of mRNA targets. In addition, mammalian genomes contain numerous natural antisense transcripts, most of which appear to be non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We have recently identified and characterized a highly conserved non-coding antisense transcript for beta-secretase-1 (BACE1), a critical enzyme in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The BACE1-antisense transcript is markedly up-regulated in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and promotes the stability of the (sense) BACE1 transcript.&#9;RESULTS: We report here that BACE1-antisense prevents miRNA-induced repression of BACE1 mRNA by masking the binding site for miR-485-5p. Indeed, miR-485-5p and BACE1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the BACE1 mRNA. We observed opposing effects of BACE1-antisense and miR-485-5p on BACE1 protein in vitro and showed that Locked Nucleic Acid-antimiR mediated knockdown of miR-485-5p as well as BACE1-antisense over-expression can prevent the miRNA-induced BACE1 suppression. We found that the expression of BACE1-antisense as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an interface between two distinct groups of regulatory RNAs in the computation of BACE1 gene expression. Moreover, bioinformatics analyses revealed a theoretical basis for many other potential interactions between natural antisense transcripts and miRNAs at the binding sites of the latter.&#9;&#9;&#9;20536606&#9;Live polio vaccine exposure while receiving anti-TNF therapy for reactive arthritis.&#9;&#9;International guidelines state that live vaccines are contraindicated in patients on anti-TNF therapy. However, we report the experience of a patient who inadvertently received live polio vaccine whilst receiving anti-TNF therapy. Patient did not suffer from any infectious sequel as a result. No clear guidelines are available for all vaccines in patients with specific rheumatic diseases. However, if we consider adult patients with rheumatic diseases to have altered immunocompetence, it is recommended that they receive the usual inactivated vaccines according to standard schedules, and live vaccines should be avoided in those who are treated with more potent forms of immune suppression. Patients should be counseled regarding the risks of live vaccines prior to treatment with anti-TNF therapy.&#9;&#9;&#9;20552018&#9;Neuronal microRNA deregulation in response to Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta.&#9;&#9;Normal brain development and function depends on microRNA (miRNA) networks to fine tune the balance between the transcriptome and proteome of the cell. These small non-coding RNA regulators are highly enriched in brain where they play key roles in neuronal development, plasticity and disease. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain miRNA profiles are altered; thus miRNA dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. Our study dissects the complexity of human AD pathology, and addresses the hypothesis that amyloid-beta (Abeta) itself, a known causative factor of AD, causes neuronal miRNA deregulation, which could contribute to the pathomechanisms of AD. We used sensitive TaqMan low density miRNA arrays (TLDA) on murine primary hippocampal cultures to show that about half of all miRNAs tested were down-regulated in response to Abeta peptides. Time-course assays of neuronal Abeta treatments show that Abeta is in fact a powerful regulator of miRNA levels as the response of certain mature miRNAs is extremely rapid. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the deregulated miRNAs are likely to affect target genes present in prominent neuronal pathways known to be disrupted in AD. Remarkably, we also found that the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures was paralleled in vivo by a deregulation in the hippocampus of Abeta42-depositing APP23 mice, at the onset of Abeta plaque formation. In addition, the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures and APP23 hippocampus overlaps with those obtained in human AD studies. Taken together, our findings suggest that neuronal miRNA deregulation in response to an insult by Abeta may be an important factor contributing to the cascade of events leading to AD.&#9;&#9;&#9;20564181&#9;Morphine treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages induces differential miRNA and protein expression: impact on inflammation and oxidative stress in the central nervous system.&#9;&#9;HIV-1-infected opiate abusers often exhibit an accelerated form of HIV-1-associated dementia and enhanced neurological dysfunction. Productive HIV-1 infection of microglia and perivascular macrophages and the resultant secretion of neurotoxic molecules by these cells contribute to this phenomenon. In order to understand the role of morphine in this process, we performed a genome-wide association study at the micro RNA (miRNA) and protein levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages (h-mdms). A total of 26 differentially expressed miRNA were identified (P &lt; 0.01), of which hsa-miR-15b and hsa-miR-181b had the greatest increase and decrease in expression levels, respectively. Computational analysis predicted fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) as the strongest target gene for hsa-miR15b. Of note, we observed a decrease in FGF-2 protein expression in response to morphine. Both hsa-miR-15b and hsa-miR-181b have several predicted gene targets involved in inflammation and T-cell activation pathways. In this context, we observed induction of MCP-2 and IL-6 by morphine. Moreover, proteomic analysis revealed the induction of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in response to morphine treatment. HIV-1 infection did not induce mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that morphine induces inflammation and oxidative stress in h-mdms thereby contributing to expansion of HIV-1 CNS reservoir expansion and disease progression. Of note, differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b and 181-b) may have a potential role in regulating these processes.&#9;&#9;&#9;20576953&#9;MicroRNAs induced during ischemic preconditioning.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are single-stranded short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by either degradation or translational repression of mRNA. Although miRNAs control a number of conditions and diseases, few neuroprotective miRNAs have been described. In this study, we investigated neuroprotective miRNAs induced early in ischemic preconditioning.&#9;METHODS: Ischemic preconditioning or focal cerebral ischemia was induced in mice by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 15 or 120 minutes. We prepared RNA samples from the ischemic cortex at 3 or 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Selective miRNAs then were synthesized and transfected into Neuro-2a cells before oxygen-glucose deprivation.&#9;RESULTS: We detected a total of 360 miRNAs. Two miRNA families, miR-200 and miR-182, were selectively upregulated at 3 hours after ischemic preconditioning. Transfections of some of these were neuroprotective in in vitro ischemia. Among them, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429 targeted prolyl hydroxylase 2 and had the best neuroprotective effect.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Two miRNA families, miR-200 and miR-182, were upregulated early after ischemic preconditioning and the miR-200 family was neuroprotective mainly by downregulating prolyl hydroxylase 2 levels. These miRNAs may be useful in future research and therapeutic applications.&#9;&#9;&#9;20585616&#9;Drosophila genome-wide RNAi screen identifies multiple regulators of HIF-dependent transcription in hypoxia.&#9;&#9;Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are a family of evolutionary conserved alpha-beta heterodimeric transcription factors that induce a wide range of genes in response to low oxygen tension. Molecular mechanisms that mediate oxygen-dependent HIF regulation operate at the level of the alpha subunit, controlling protein stability, subcellular localization, and transcriptional coactivator recruitment. We have conducted an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila cells aimed to the identification of genes required for HIF activity. After 3 rounds of selection, 30 genes emerged as critical HIF regulators in hypoxia, most of which had not been previously associated with HIF biology. The list of genes includes components of chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription elongation factors, and translational regulators. One remarkable hit was the argonaute 1 (ago1) gene, a central element of the microRNA (miRNA) translational silencing machinery. Further studies confirmed the physiological role of the miRNA machinery in HIF-dependent transcription. This study reveals the occurrence of novel mechanisms of HIF regulation, which might contribute to developing novel strategies for therapeutic intervention of HIF-related pathologies, including heart attack, cancer, and stroke.&#9;&#9;&#9;20591823&#9;A myriad of miRNA variants in control and Huntington's disease brain regions detected by massively parallel sequencing.&#9;&#9;Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects neurons of the forebrain. We have applied the Illumina massively parallel sequencing to deeply analyze the small RNA populations of two different forebrain areas, the frontal cortex (FC) and the striatum (ST) of healthy individuals and individuals with HD. More than 80% of the small-RNAs were annotated as microRNAs (miRNAs) in all samples. Deep sequencing revealed length and sequence heterogeneity (IsomiRs) for the vast majority of miRNAs. Around 80-90% of the miRNAs presented modifications in the 3'-terminus mainly in the form of trimming and/or as nucleotide addition variants, while the 5'-terminus of the miRNAs was specially protected from changes. Expression profiling showed strong miRNA and isomiR expression deregulation in HD, most being common to both FC and ST. The analysis of the upstream regulatory regions in co-regulated miRNAs suggests a role for RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) and P53 in miRNAs downregulation in HD. The putative targets of deregulated miRNAs and seed-region IsomiRs strongly suggest that their altered expression contributes to the aberrant gene expression in HD. Our results show that miRNA variability is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the adult human brain, which may influence gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions.&#9;&#9;&#9;20616011&#9;miRNA malfunction causes spinal motor neuron disease.&#9;&#9;Defective RNA metabolism is an emerging mechanism involved in ALS pathogenesis and possibly in other neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we show that microRNA (miRNA) activity is essential for long-term survival of postmitotic spinal motor neurons (SMNs) in vivo. Thus, mice that do not process miRNA in SMNs exhibit hallmarks of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including sclerosis of the spinal cord ventral horns, aberrant end plate architecture, and myofiber atrophy with signs of denervation. Furthermore, a neurofilament heavy subunit previously implicated in motor neuron degeneration is specifically up-regulated in miRNA-deficient SMNs. We demonstrate that the heavy neurofilament subunit is a target of miR-9, a miRNA that is specifically down-regulated in a genetic model of SMA. These data provide evidence for miRNA function in SMN diseases and emphasize the potential role of miR-9-based regulatory mechanisms in adult neurons and neurodegenerative states.&#9;&#9;&#9;20630759&#9;Control of RNA silencing and localization by endolysosomes.&#9;&#9;Recent advances in the cell biology of RNA silencing have unraveled an intriguing association of post-transcriptionally regulated RNA with endolysosomal membranes in several circumstances of mRNA localization, microRNA activity and viral RNA transport and packaging. Endolysosomal membranes are a nexus of communication and transport between cells and their exterior environment for signaling receptors, pathogens and nutrients. Here, we discuss recent data that support a view that endolysosomal positioning of RNA might facilitate intercellular transmission of RNA and host defence against viruses and retrotransposons. Positioning of RNA regulatory mechanisms on endolysosomal membranes might permit rapid and localized control of microRNA (miRNA) gene regulatory programs and mRNA translation in response to environmental signals, such as activated plasma membrane receptors transported on endosomes. Finally, we suggest that the pathology of several conditions, including Huntington's disease, might be a consequence of the disruption of the control of RNA via endolysosomal membranes.&#9;&#9;&#9;20660113&#9;Genetic ablation of Dicer in adult forebrain neurons results in abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration.&#9;&#9;Type III RNase Dicer is responsible for the maturation and function of microRNA (miRNA) molecules in the cell. It is now well-documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in neuronal death, particularly in the adult brain, remain poorly defined. Here we show that the absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype. Although neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology. Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo. We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo. Finally, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In summary, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation.&#9;&#9;&#9;20667897&#9;Pyruvate kinase M2 is a target of the tumor-suppressive microRNA-326 and regulates the survival of glioma cells.&#9;&#9;Emerging studies have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as possible therapeutic tools for the treatment of glioma, the most aggressive brain tumor. Their important targets in this tumor are not well understood. We recently found that the Notch pathway is a target of miRNA-326. Ectopic expression of miRNA-326 in glioma and glioma stem cells induced their apoptosis and reduced their metabolic activity. Computational target gene prediction revealed pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) as another target of miRNA-326. PKM2 has recently been shown to play a key role in cancer cell metabolism. To investigate whether it might be a functionally important target of miR-326, we used RNA interference to knockdown PKM2 expression in glioma cells. Transfection of the established glioma and glioma stem cells with PKM2 siRNA reduced their growth, cellular invasion, metabolic activity, ATP and glutathione levels, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase. The cytotoxic effects exhibited by PKM2 knockdown in glioma and glioma stem cells were not observed in transformed human astrocytes. Western blot analysis of human glioblastoma specimens showed high levels of PKM2 protein, but none was observed in normal brain samples. Strikingly, cells with high levels of PKM2 expressed lower levels of miR-326, suggestive of endogenous regulation of PKM2 by miR-326. Our data suggest PKM2 inhibition as a therapy for glioblastoma, with the potential for minimal toxicity to the brain.&#9;&#9;&#9;20668041&#9;Down-regulation of Wee1 kinase by a specific subset of microRNA in human sporadic pituitary adenomas.&#9;&#9;CONTEXT: The tumorigenic mechanisms involved in pituitary adenomas, especially of nonfunctional pituitary adenomas (NFAs), remains unclear. Various cell cycle inhibitors have been found to be underexpressed in pituitary tumors; however, Wee1 kinase, a nuclear protein that delays mitosis and was recently recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, has not been previously investigated in pituitary tumors.&#9;OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the expression of Wee1 in pituitary tumors and to identify microRNAs (miRs) that can regulate its expression.&#9;DESIGN: Expression of Wee1 was examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Identification of miRs targeting the Wee1 3'-untranslated region was performed by miR array followed by expression analysis of identified miRs using qRT-PCR. Dual-luciferase assay and transient transfection of miRs into Hela cells followed by immunoblot analysis of Wee1 protein and cell proliferation analysis were carried out.&#9;PATIENTS: A total of 57 pituitary tissue samples including 27 NFAs, 15 GH-producing adenomas with or without prolactin overproduction, and 15 normal pituitary glands were analyzed.&#9;RESULTS: Wee1 protein expression was decreased in NFAs and GH-producing tumors with or without prolactin production, but no change in mRNA expression was observed with qRT-PCR. A specific subset of five miRNAs revealed by in silico target prediction was significantly overexpressed in NFA samples; three miRs (miR-128a, miR-155, and miR-516a-3p) targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the Wee1 transcript, and exogenous overexpression of these miRs inhibited Wee1 protein expression and HeLa cell proliferation.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that regulation of Wee1 kinase by miRs may be linked to pituitary tumorigenesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;20671708&#9;Pathogenic LRRK2 negatively regulates microRNA-mediated translational repression.&#9;&#9;Gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause familial as well as sporadic Parkinson's disease characterized by age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The molecular mechanism of LRRK2 action is not known. Here we show that LRRK2 interacts with the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate protein synthesis. Drosophila e2f1 and dp messenger RNAs are translationally repressed by let-7 and miR-184*, respectively. Pathogenic LRRK2 antagonizes these miRNAs, leading to the overproduction of E2F1/DP, previously implicated in cell cycle and survival control and shown here to be critical for LRRK2 pathogenesis. Genetic deletion of let-7, antagomir-mediated blockage of let-7 and miR-184* action, transgenic expression of dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous dp with a dp transgene non-responsive to let-7 each had toxic effects similar to those of pathogenic LRRK2. Conversely, increasing the level of let-7 or miR-184* attenuated pathogenic LRRK2 effects. LRRK2 associated with Drosophila Argonaute-1 (dAgo1) or human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2) of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In aged fly brain, dAgo1 protein level was negatively regulated by LRRK2. Further, pathogenic LRRK2 promoted the association of phospho-4E-BP1 with hAgo2. Our results implicate deregulated synthesis of E2F1/DP caused by the miRNA pathway impairment as a key event in LRRK2 pathogenesis and suggest novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies.&#9;&#9;&#9;20678503&#9;The miR-15/107 group of microRNA genes: evolutionary biology, cellular functions, and roles in human diseases.&#9;&#9;The miR-15/107 group of microRNA (miRNA) gene is increasingly appreciated to serve key functions in humans. These miRNAs regulate gene expression involved in cell division, metabolism, stress response, and angiogenesis in vertebrate species. The miR-15/107 group has also been implicated in human cancers, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we provide an overview of the following: (1) the evolution of miR-15/107 group member genes; (2) the expression levels of miRNAs in mammalian tissues; (3) evidence for overlapping gene-regulatory functions by different miRNAs; (4) the normal biochemical pathways regulated by miR-15/107 group miRNAs; and (5) the roles played by these miRNAs in human diseases. Membership in this group is defined based on sequence similarity near the mature miRNAs' 5' end: all include the sequence AGCAGC. Phylogeny of this group of miRNAs is incomplete; thus, a definitive taxonomic classification (e.g., designation as a &quot;superfamily&quot;) is currently not possible. While all vertebrates studied to date express miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-103, and miR-107, mammals alone are known to express miR-195, miR-424, miR-497, miR-503, and miR-646. Multiple different miRNAs in the miR-15/107 group are expressed at moderate to high levels in human tissues. We present data on the expression of all known miR-15/107 group members in human cerebral cortical gray matter and white matter using new miRNA profiling microarrays. There is extensive overlap in the mRNAs targeted by miR-15/107 group members. We show new data from cultured H4 cancer cells that demonstrate similarities in mRNAs targeted by miR-16 and miR-103 and also support the importance of the mature miRNAs' 5' seed region in mRNA target recognition. In conclusion, the miR-15/107 group of miRNA genes is a fascinating topic of study for evolutionary biologists, miRNA biochemists, and clinically oriented translational researchers alike.&#9;&#9;&#9;20709030&#9;miR-106b aberrantly expressed in a double transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease targets TGF-β type II receptor.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundantly expressed in the brain and play an important role in disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Growing body of evidence suggests that the TGF-β signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs involved in AD pathogenesis by regulating TGF-β signaling. Here we found that miR-106b and TGF-β type II receptor (TβR II) were aberrantly expressed in APPswe/PS∆E9 mice (a double transgenic mouse model for AD). Sequence analysis revealed two putative binding sites for miR-106b in the 3' UTR of the TβR II mRNA. Our results showed that the expression of miR-106b was inversely correlated with TβR II protein levels and miR-106b can directly inhibit the TβR II translation in vitro. After induced neurodifferentiation with all-trans retinoic acid, we observed significant neurodegeneration in SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with miR-106b. Western blot analysis revealed unchanged total Smad2/3 protein levels, but reduced phospho-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) and increased Smad6/7 protein levels in the miR-106b stably transfected cell line. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to Aβ42 oligomers led to the expression of miR-106b was first increased and then decreased and TβR II levels reduced. Our in vitro results suggested that Aβ42 oligomer-induced miR-106b leads to impairment in TGF-β signaling through TβR II, concomitant with retinoic acid-induced neurodegeneration in SH-SY5Y cells. These results show that TβR II is a functional target of miR-106b and that miR-106b may influence TGF-β signaling, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of AD.&#9;&#9;&#9;20711171&#9;Genome-wide expression profiling identifies deregulated miRNAs in malignant astrocytoma.&#9;&#9;Malignant astrocytoma includes anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and glioblastoma (grade IV). Among them, glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor with dismal responses to all therapeutic modalities. We performed a large-scale, genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) (n=756) expression profiling of 26 glioblastoma, 13 anaplastic astrocytoma and 7 normal brain samples with an aim to find deregulated miRNA in malignant astrocytoma. We identified several differentially regulated miRNAs between these groups, which could differentiate glioma grades and normal brain as recognized by PCA. More importantly, we identified a most discriminatory 23-miRNA expression signature, by using PAM, which precisely distinguished glioblastoma from anaplastic astrocytoma with an accuracy of 95%. The differential expression pattern of nine miRNAs was further validated by real-time RT-PCR on an independent set of malignant astrocytomas (n=72) and normal samples (n=7). Inhibition of two glioblastoma-upregulated miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-23a) and exogenous overexpression of two glioblastoma-downregulated miRNAs (miR-218 and miR-219-5p) resulted in reduced soft agar colony formation but showed varying effects on cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. Thus we have identified the miRNA expression signature for malignant astrocytoma, in particular glioblastoma, and showed the miRNA involvement and their importance in astrocytoma development.&#9;&#9;&#9;20797687&#9;Mutations in ABHD12 cause the neurodegenerative disease PHARC: An inborn error of endocannabinoid metabolism.&#9;&#9;Polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by early-onset cataract and hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and cerebellar ataxia. Previously, we mapped this Refsum-like disorder to a 16 Mb region on chromosome 20. Here we report that mutations in the ABHD12 gene cause PHARC disease and we describe the clinical manifestations in a total of 19 patients from four different countries. The ABHD12 enzyme was recently shown to hydrolyze 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), the main endocannabinoid lipid transmitter that acts on cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Our data therefore represent an example of an inherited disorder related to endocannabinoid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a wide range of physiological processes including neurotransmission, mood, appetite, pain appreciation, addiction behavior, and inflammation, and several potential drugs targeting these pathways are in development for clinical applications. Our findings show that ABHD12 performs essential functions in both the central and peripheral nervous systems and the eye. Any future drug-mediated interference with this enzyme should consider the potential risk of long-term adverse effects.&#9;&#9;&#9;20826435&#9;Rundataxin, a novel protein with RUN and diacylglycerol binding domains, is mutant in a new recessive ataxia.&#9;&#9;We have identified a novel form of recessive ataxia that segregates in three children of a large consanguineous Saudi Arabian family. The three patients presented with childhood onset gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria and had limited walking without aid into their teenage years. Two patients developed epilepsy at 7 months without relapse after treatment, and mental retardation. Linkage studies allowed us to identify a single locus that segregated with the disease on chromosome 3q28-qter. Mutation screening of all coding sequences revealed a single nucleotide deletion, 2927delC, in exon 19 of the KIAA0226 gene, which results in a frame shift of the C-terminal domain (p.Ala943ValfsX146). The KIAA0226 gene encodes a protein that we named rundataxin, with two conserved domains: an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal domain containing a diacylglycerol binding-like motif. The closest paralogue of rundataxin, the plekstrin homology domain family member M1, has been shown to colocalize with Rab7, a small GTPase associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, suggesting that rundataxin may also be associated with vesicular trafficking and signalling pathways through its RUN and diacylglycerol binding-like domains. The rundataxin pathway appears therefore distinct from the ataxia pathways involving deficiency in mitochondrial or nuclear proteins and broadens the range of mechanisms leading to recessive ataxias.&#9;&#9;&#9;20841486&#9;Functional microRNA is transferred between glioma cells.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNA) are single-stranded 17- to 27-nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by posttranscriptional silencing of target mRNAs. Here, we transformed rat 9L gliosarcoma cells to express cel-miR-67, a miRNA that lacks homology in rat. Coculture of these cells with cells that expressed a luciferase reporter that contained a complementary sequence to cel-miR-67 resulted in significant suppression of luciferase expression. This effect was also observed in the U87-MG human glioma cell line. Moreover, luciferase suppression was inhibited by the addition of carbenoxolone to cocultures, suggesting that gap junction communication regulates intercellular transfer of miRNA. Finally, in situ hybridization revealed the presence of cel-miR-67 in cel-miR-67-null 9L cells after coculture with cel-miR-67-expressing cells. Our data show that miRNA transcribed in glioma cells can be transferred to adjacent cells and induces targeted inhibition of protein expression in the acceptor cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of targeted intercellular protein regulation between brain tumor cells.&#9;&#9;&#9;20883153&#9;Human traumatic brain injury alters plasma microRNA levels.&#9;&#9;Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) present in the serum/plasma are characteristically altered in many pathological conditions, and have been employed as diagnostic markers for specific diseases. We examined if plasma miRNA levels are altered in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) relative to matched healthy volunteers, and explored their potential for use as diagnostic TBI biomarkers. The plasma miRNA profiles from severe TBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≤8) and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy volunteers were compared by microarray analysis. Of the 108 miRNAs identified in healthy volunteer plasma, 52 were altered after severe TBI, including 33 with decreased and 19 with increased relative abundance. An additional 8 miRNAs were detected only in the TBI plasma. We used quantitative RT-PCR to determine if plasma miRNAs could identify TBI patients within the first 24 h post-injury. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that miR-16, miR-92a, and miR-765 were good markers of severe TBI (0.89, 0.82, and 0.86 AUC values, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that combining these miRNAs markedly increased diagnostic accuracy (100% specificity and 100% sensitivity), compared to either healthy volunteers or orthopedic injury patients. In mild TBI patients (GCS score &gt; 12), miR-765 levels were unchanged, while the plasma levels of miR-92a and miR-16 were significantly increased within the first 24 h of injury compared to healthy volunteers, and had AUC values of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively. Our results demonstrate that circulating miRNA levels are altered after TBI, providing a rich new source of potential molecular biomarkers. Plasma-derived miRNA biomarkers, used in combination with established clinical practices such as imaging, neurocognitive, and motor examinations, have the potential to improve TBI patient classification and possibly management.&#9;&#9;&#9;20886384&#9;Oncolytic adenoviruses for the treatment of brain tumors.&#9;&#9;In recent years, oncolytic viruses have been genetically engineered to target cancer cells selectively. Adenovirus is one such oncolytic virus that is being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The observation that cells infected with replication-competent adenoviruses undergo autophagy has provided new options for investigating the mechanism of adenovirus-induced cell death. It has been suggested that the use of autophagy inducers, such as rapamycin, can enhance the oncolytic potency of recombinant adenoviruses. Additionally, several research groups have established that inserting microRNA (miRNA)-targeted sequences into the adenoviral genome can modulate adenoviral protein expression to confer tissue and tumor selectivity. Furthermore, the capability of adenoviruses to inhibit the expression of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT and to chemosensitize glioma cells to temozolomide has been demonstrated. This review discusses three aspects of the use of oncolytic adenoviruses to treat cancer: (i) the induction of autophagy and autophagic cell death during adenoviral replication; (ii) the opportunities and strategies involved in the exploitation of miRNA specificity to generate tissue- and tumor-selective oncolytic viruses; and (iii) the rationale for combining oncolytic adenoviruses with chemotherapeutic agents.&#9;&#9;&#9;20936480&#9;Patterns of microRNA expression in normal and early Alzheimer's disease human temporal cortex: white matter versus gray matter.&#9;&#9;MicroRNA (miRNA) expression was assessed in human cerebral cortical gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in order to provide the first insights into the difference between GM and WM miRNA repertoires across a range of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. RNA was isolated separately from GM and WM portions of superior and middle temporal cerebral cortex (N = 10 elderly females, postmortem interval &lt; 4 h). miRNA profiling experiments were performed using state-of-the-art Exiqon(©) LNA-microarrays. A subset of miRNAs that appeared to be strongly expressed according to the microarrays did not appear to be conventional miRNAs according to Northern blot analyses. Some well-characterized miRNAs were substantially enriched in WM as expected. However, most of the miRNA expression variability that correlated with the presence of early AD-related pathology was seen in GM. We confirm that downregulation of a set of miRNAs in GM (including several miR-15/107 genes and miR-29 paralogs) correlated strongly with the density of diffuse amyloid plaques detected in adjacent tissue. A few miRNAs were differentially expressed in WM, including miR-212 that is downregulated in AD and miR-424 which is upregulated in AD. The expression of certain miRNAs correlates with other miRNAs across different cases, and particular subsets of miRNAs are coordinately expressed in relation to AD-related pathology. These data support the hypothesis that patterns of miRNA expression in cortical GM may contribute to AD pathogenetically, because the aggregate change in miRNA expression observed early in the disease would be predicted to cause profound changes in gene expression.&#9;&#9;&#9;20937840&#9;Differential regulation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-2 by microRNA-146a and NF-kappaB in stressed human astroglial cells and in Alzheimer disease.&#9;&#9;Specific microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that support homeostatic gene expression, are significantly altered in abundance in human neurological disorders. In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-κB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling. Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1β+Aβ42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.&#9;&#9;&#9;20953120&#9;MicroRNAs and their therapeutic potential for human diseases: aberrant microRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease brains.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small noncoding RNAs that regulate translational repression of multiple target mRNAs. The miRNAs in a whole cell regulate greater than 30% of all protein-coding genes. The vast majority of presently identified miRNAs are expressed in the brain in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. They play a key role in neuronal development, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. However, at present, the pathological implications of deregulated miRNA expression in neurodegenerative diseases remain largely unknown. This review will briefly summarize recent studies that focus attention on aberrant miRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease brains.&#9;&#9;&#9;20960104&#9;MicroRNA expression in ACTH-producing pituitary tumors: up-regulation of microRNA-122 and -493 in pituitary carcinomas.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and can function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. The expression of miRNAs in pituitary carcinomas has not been previously examined. We used miRNA profiling with 1,145 probes to study miRNA expression in normal anterior pituitary (6 cases), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-producing adenomas (8 cases), and ACTH-producing pituitary carcinomas (two cases). Real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were used to confirm and independently validate miRNAs that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated between the pituitary tissues. There were more miRNAs up- (188) or down-regulated (160) between adenomas and normal pituitaries compared to carcinomas and normal pituitaries (92 up- and 91 down-regulated) or between carcinomas and adenomas (46 up- and 52 down-regulated). Both real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization showed significant up-regulation of miRNA-122 between pituitary carcinomas and adenomas. MiRNA-493 was also up-regulated in carcinomas compared to ACTH adenomas. Analysis of genes that miRNA-493 interacts with included LGALS3 and RUNX2 ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk ) both of which have been shown to have roles in pituitary tumor cell growth. These results provide information about marker miRNAs that may lead to further insights into the regulation of pituitary tumor growth and development.&#9;&#9;&#9;21035445&#9;Altered microRNA regulation in Huntington's disease models.&#9;&#9;Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. However, the profiles and regulation of miRNAs in HD are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed the miRNA expression and miRNA regulators in two transgenic models of HD, YAC128 and R6/2 mice, and in a 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP)-induced striatal degeneration rat model. After characterizing the phenotypes by behavioral tests and histological analyses, we profiled striatal miRNAs using a miRNA microarray and we measured the key molecules involved in miRNA biogenesis and function. YAC128 mice showed upregulation-dominant miRNA expressions at 5 months and downregulation-dominant expressions at 12 months. Concomitantly, the expressions of Drosha-DGCR8, Exportin-5, and Dcp1 were increased at 5months, and the expression of Dicer was decreased at 12 months. In 10-week-old R6/2 mice, downregulation was dominant in the miRNA expressions and the level of Drosha decreased concomitantly. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. Meanwhile, 3NP rats showed dynamic changes in the miRNA profiles during disease development and a few miRNAs with altered expression. Our results show that transgenic HD mice have abnormal miRNA biogenesis. This information should aid in future studies on therapeutic application of miRNAs in HD.&#9;&#9;&#9;21049191&#9;Microsurgical clipping in forty patients with unruptured anterior cerebral circulation aneurysms: an investigation into cognitive outcome.&#9;&#9;OBJECTIVE: It is a consensus that most unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) can be treated with acceptably low morbidity. However, some studies recently reported postoperative cognitive impairment, suggesting that it could be attributable to surgical damage. Our goal is to evaluate cognitive function before and after microsurgical clipping in patients with UIA.&#9;METHOD: A consecutive series of 40 patients who underwent microsurgical clipping for UIA were studied. The cognitive assessment (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) was performed immediately before and at least one month after surgery. Paired Student's &quot;t&quot; test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical purposes.&#9;RESULTS: The mean MMSE score in the preoperative analysis was 28.12 (SD, 1.34). In the postoperative period the mean MMSE score was 28.40 (SD, 1.46). Paired Student's &quot;t&quot; test was applied to the scores and no significant difference was found (p = 0.315). ANOVA did not find independent associations between MMSE scores and age, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, education, aneurysm location, number, laterality or size.&#9;CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that microsurgical clipping for UIA does not result in major cognitive dysfunction as determined by the MMSE.&#9;&#9;&#9;21062284&#9;In vivo regulation of amyloid precursor protein neuronal splicing by microRNAs.&#9;&#9;The β-amyloid peptide that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain derive from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recent evidence suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of APP expression. Because gene dosage effects of the APP gene can cause genetic AD, dysregulation of the miRNA network could contribute significantly to disease. Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects β-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;21080802&#9;Potential role of miRNAs and their inhibitors in glioma treatment.&#9;&#9;Recent years have seen an intense period of research on the functions of miRNAs, recently discovered key regulators of gene expression that act through suppression of translation of target mRNAs. Several hundred miRNAs have been identified in humans, and these show characteristic expression patterns, depending on tissue type, cell type or environmental stimuli. Like other types of cancer, the brain tumor glioblastoma shows a distinct miRNA expression signature, and a number of recent studies have linked these miRNA alterations to key hallmarks of glioblastoma including proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis and stem cell-like behavior. These studies have opened the door to the possibility of utilizing miRNAs or miRNA antagonists as therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain tumors.&#9;&#9;&#9;21084719&#9;Identification of hematopoietic stem cell-specific miRNAs enables gene therapy of globoid cell leukodystrophy.&#9;&#9;Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD; also known as Krabbe disease) is an invariably fatal lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) gene. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy is being explored for GLD; however, we found that forced GALC expression was toxic to HSCs and early progenitors, highlighting the need for improved regulation of vector expression. We used a genetic reporter strategy based on lentiviral vectors to detect microRNA activity in hematopoietic cells at single-cell resolution. We report that miR-126 and miR-130a were expressed in HSCs and early progenitors from both mice and humans, but not in differentiated progeny. Moreover, repopulating HSCs could be purified solely on the basis of miRNA expression, providing a new method relevant for human HSC isolation. By incorporating miR-126 target sequences into a GALC-expressing vector, we suppressed GALC expression in HSCs while maintaining robust expression in mature hematopoietic cells. This approach protected HSCs from GALC toxicity and allowed successful treatment of a mouse GLD model, providing a rationale to explore HSC-based gene therapy for GLD.&#9;&#9;&#9;21092923&#9;Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 12.5 Mb homozygous region reveals ANO10 mutations in patients with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia.&#9;&#9;Autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxias comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast to their dominant counterparts, unraveling the molecular background of these ataxias has proven to be more complicated and the currently known mutations provide incomplete coverage for genotyping of patients. By combining SNP array-based linkage analysis and targeted resequencing of relevant sequences in the linkage interval with the use of next-generation sequencing technology, we identified a mutation in a gene and have shown its association with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia. In a Dutch consanguineous family with three affected siblings a homozygous 12.5 Mb region on chromosome 3 was targeted by array-based sequence capture. Prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to four candidate genes, one of which contained a variant with a high base pair conservation score (phyloP score: 5.26). This variant was a leucine-to-arginine substitution in the DUF 590 domain of a 16K transmembrane protein, a putative calcium-activated chloride channel encoded by anoctamin 10 (ANO10). The analysis of ANO10 by Sanger sequencing revealed three additional mutations: a homozygous mutation (c.1150_1151del [p.Leu384fs]) in a Serbian family and a compound-heterozygous splice-site mutation (c.1476+1G&gt;T) and a frameshift mutation (c.1604del [p.Leu535X]) in a French family. This illustrates the power of using initial homozygosity mapping with next-generation sequencing technology to identify genes involved in autosomal-recessive diseases. Moreover, identifying a putative calcium-dependent chloride channel involved in cerebellar ataxia adds another pathway to the list of pathophysiological mechanisms that may cause cerebellar ataxia.&#9;&#9;&#9;21095568&#9;Allele-selective inhibition of huntingtin expression by switching to an miRNA-like RNAi mechanism.&#9;&#9;Inhibiting expression of huntingtin (HTT) protein is a promising strategy for treating Huntington's disease (HD), but indiscriminant inhibition of both wild-type and mutant alleles may lead to toxicity. An ideal silencing agent would block expression of mutant HTT while leaving expression of wild-type HTT intact. We observe that fully complementary duplex RNAs targeting the expanded CAG repeat within HTT mRNA block expression of both alleles. Switching the RNAi mechanism toward that used by miRNAs by introducing one or more mismatched bases into these duplex RNAs leads to potent (&lt;10 nM) and highly selective (&gt;30-fold relative to wild-type HTT) inhibition of mutant HTT expression in patient-derived cells. Potent, allele selective inhibition of HTT by mismatched RNAs provides a new option for developing HD therapeutics.&#9;&#9;&#9;21098324&#9;Integrative genomic analysis of medulloblastoma identifies a molecular subgroup that drives poor clinical outcome.&#9;&#9;PURPOSE Medulloblastomas are heterogeneous tumors that collectively represent the most common malignant brain tumor in children. To understand the molecular characteristics underlying their heterogeneity and to identify whether such characteristics represent risk factors for patients with this disease, we performed an integrated genomic analysis of a large series of primary tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS We profiled the mRNA transcriptome of 194 medulloblastomas and performed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array and miRNA analysis on 115 and 98 of these, respectively. Non-negative matrix factorization-based clustering of mRNA expression data was used to identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma; DNA copy number, miRNA profiles, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for each. We additionally validated our findings in three previously published independent medulloblastoma data sets. Results Identified are six molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, each with a unique combination of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations that globally influence mRNA and miRNA expression. We reveal the relative contribution of each subgroup to clinical outcome as a whole and show that a previously unidentified molecular subgroup, characterized genetically by c-MYC copy number gains and transcriptionally by enrichment of photoreceptor pathways and increased miR-183∼96∼182 expression, is associated with significantly lower rates of event-free and overall survivals. CONCLUSION Our results detail the complex genomic heterogeneity of medulloblastomas and identify a previously unrecognized molecular subgroup with poor clinical outcome for which more effective therapeutic strategies should be developed.&#9;&#9;&#9;21118127&#9;The involvement of microRNAs in Type 2 diabetes.&#9;&#9;T2D (Type 2 diabetes mellitus) is a major health issue that has reached epidemic status worldwide. T2D is a progressive metabolic disorder characterized by reduced insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Improper treatment of TD2 can lead to severe complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage. The aetiology and molecular mechanisms of T2D are not fully understood, but compelling evidence points to a link between T2D, obesity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. Although T2D seems to be strongly linked to environmental factors such as nutrition and lifestyle, studies have shown that genetic factors, such as polymorphisms associated with metabolic genes, imprinting, fetal programming and miRNA (microRNA) expression, could also contribute to the development of this disease. miRNAs are small 22-25-nt-long untranslated RNAs that negatively regulate the translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are involved in a large number of biological functions such as development, metabolism, immunity and diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The present review examines the various miRNAs that have been identified as being potentially involved in T2D, focusing on the insulin-sensitive organs: white adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle and the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells.&#9;&#9;&#9;21122469&#9;Gene regulation through RNA editing.&#9;&#9;RNA editing by adenosine deamination is a posttranscriptional mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and is particularly widespread in mammals. A-to-I RNA editing generates transcriptome and proteome diversity allowing organisms to produce many more gene products and functions than predicted based on the number of genes within their genome. Also, it regulates important functional properties of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the central nervous system by changing single codons in pre-mRNA. The deficiency or misregulation of editing has been implicated in the etiology of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), depression and tumor progression. Widespread A-to-I modification of repeat sequences in the human transcriptome suggests additional roles for RNA editing and links it to other processes of gene regulation, such as RNA splicing as well as siRNA mediated gene silencing and miRNA function. Here, I am reviewing main features of this epigenetic phenomenon, its relevance for health and disease, as well as potential prospects for using RNA editing as a therapeutic tool.&#9;&#9;&#9;21126225&#9;Targeting the arrhythmogenic substrate in atrial fibrillation: focus on structural remodeling.&#9;&#9;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an emerging clinical problem with multifaceted issues: current and expected prevalence, significant morbidity, potentially fatal outcome (e.g., stroke) and gaps in therapeutic approaches. Current anti-arrhythmic strategies not only fail to guarantee effective rhythm control, but also cause &quot;on target&quot; (i.e., pro-arrhythmia, namely torsade de pointes) and &quot;off target&quot; (i.e., extra-cardiac toxicities) side effects. Although a number of drugs have just come out of the pipeline with promising results (e.g., dronedarone), the question arises whether channel-targeted drugs represent the only viable approach. A body of evidence has emerged supporting structural remodeling as the main arrhythmogenic substrate perpetuating AF. Fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress appear strongly interconnected in the pathogenesis of remodeling-induced abnormalities. Moreover, insights into extracellular matrix network strongly suggested an active cross-talk within the cardiac microenvironment, which should be further investigated as promising &quot;anti-remodeling&quot; approach. Therefore, pharmacological modulation of non-ionic targets (the so called &quot;upstream&quot; therapy) has gained interest as a preventive strategy in AF. At the present state of knowledge, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and statins offer evidence for potential clinical exploitation, while several remodeling-targeted therapies have been tested only experimentally or failed when studied for human validation. Fascinating and innovative strategies have been proposed (e.g., miRNAs modulation), but the actual benefit is debated. This review will provide mechanistic insights into structural remodeling and highlight emerging upstream strategies in AF management.&#9;&#9;&#9;21138567&#9;Differential expression of microRNAs in GH-secreting pituitary adenomas.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to (1) identify specific miRNAs in growth hormones (GH)-secreting pituitary adenomas; (2) determine the relationship between the expression of these miRNAs and tumor size, somatostatin analogs treatment, and responsiveness to somatostatin analogs (SSA).&#9;METHODS: Fifteen GH-secreting adenomas patients were treated with lanreotide for 4 months before surgery. Patients with 50% reduction of GH secretion by lanreotide were considered as SSA responders, while patients with less than 50% of GH reduction were considered as SSA nonresponders. We analyzed the miRNAs in 21 GH-secreting pituitary adenomas and 6 normal pituitaries by miRCURY™ LNA array and some differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR.&#9;RESULTS: Fifty-two miRNAs were differentially expressed between GH-secreting pituitary adenomas and normal pituitaries. Differential expression of 9 miRNAs was observed between micro- and macro-adenomas. Thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between tumor samples from lanreotide-treated patients and those from lanreotide-untreated patients. Seven miRNAs were differentially expressed between SSA responders or GH nonresponders. Several identified miRNAs may be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cancer development and progression.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that altered miRNAs expression is involved in GH-secreting pituitary adenomas transformation, which will shed light on the mechanisms for the treatment of acromegaly by SSA. Identification and characterization of the targets of altered miRNAs genes may elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenoma.&#9;&#9;&#9;21143783&#9;Investigation gene and microRNA expression in glioblastoma.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Though a lot of research has been focused on this disease, the causes and pathogenesis of glioblastoma have not been indentified clearly.&#9;RESULTS: We indentified 1,236 significantly differentially expressed genes, and 30 pathways enriched in the set of differentially expressed genes among 243 tumor and 11 normal samples. We also indentified 97 differentially expressed microRNAs among 240 tumor and 10 normal samples. 22 of which have been reported to affect glioblastoma and 50 of which were implicated in other cancers and brain diseases. We regressed gene expression on microRNA expression in 237 tumor tissues and 10 normal tissues comprehensively. We found two experimentally validated microRNA targets and 1,094 miRNA-target gene pairs in our datasets which were predicted by miRanda algorithm, 8 of the target genes were tumor suppressor genes and 3 were oncogenes. Further function analysis of target genes suggested that microRNAs most frequently targeted genes associated with Cell Signalling and Nervous System.&#9;CONCLUSION: We investigated gene and microRNA Expression in Glioblastoma and gave a comprehensive function study of differential expressed gene and microRNA in glioblastoma patients. These findings gave important clues to study of the carcinogenic process in glioblastomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;21157891&#9;Survey of MicroRNA expression in pediatric brain tumors.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: A better understanding of pediatric brain tumor biology is needed to assist in the development of less toxic therapies and to provide better markers for disease stratification. MicroRNAs (miRNA) may play a significant role in brain tumor biology. The present study provides an initial survey of miRNA expression in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) malignancies including atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma.&#9;PROCEDURE: MicroRNA expression in pediatric brain tumors and normal tissue controls was examined by microarray. Three aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further studied in a larger cohort by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).&#9;RESULTS: MicroRNA-129, miR-142-5p, and miR-25 were differentially expressed in every pediatric brain tumor type compared to normal tissue controls as measured by microarray. When further examined by qRT-PCR, these miRNAs demonstrated differential expression that significantly correlated with the microarray findings. Distinctive miRNA expression profiles were also observed in the different pediatric brain tumor types.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are differentially expressed between pediatric CNS neoplasms and normal tissue suggesting that they may play a significant role in oncogenesis. A greater understanding of aberrant miRNA expression in pediatric brain tumors may aid in the development of novel therapies. The characterization of tumor-specific miRNA signatures may aid in the discovery of biomarkers with diagnostic or prognostic utility.&#9;&#9;&#9;21162128&#9;Altered expression of miRNA-21 and its targets in the hippocampus after traumatic brain injury.&#9;&#9;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates many different signaling cascades throughout the brain that impact both pathophysiological and neuroprotective processes. Cellular mechanisms that can modulate these processes may play an important role in determining the nature and extent of the damage suffered after TBI and therefore influence overall outcome after injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of noncoding regulatory RNAs providing an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of protein expression levels of target genes. We report that miR-21 expression is significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus after rodent TBI, with expression levels peaking by 3 days postinjury and returning to near sham levels by 15 days postinjury. In situ localization of miR-21 transcripts indicates widespread expression in normal brain, with a pronounced increase in expression after TBI evident throughout the cortex and hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus and CA3 cell layer. We used a combination of the miRanda, TargetScan, and PicTar prediction algorithms to identify 99 potential target genes that possess miR-21 binding sites within their 3' untranslated regions. Analysis of these genes' annotated Gene Ontology molecular function and biological process terms revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in enzyme-linked receptor signaling, transcriptional regulation, and developmental processes. These results suggest that increased miR-21 expression in the hippocampus may influence multiple components of TBI pathophysiology.&#9;&#9;&#9;21166051&#9;[Interaction of microRNA-338 and its potential targeting protein eiF4E3].&#9;&#9;OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interaction between the microRNA-338 and its targeting proteins during the cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.&#9;METHODS: TargetScan was used to predict the targets of microRNA-338. The potential targeting proteins were then selected according to their secondary structures using RNA structure 4.6 software and their involvement in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury was studied. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to testify whether microRNA-338 can recognize the 3'UTR of target protein. Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of eiF4E3 in both experimental group and control group.&#9;RESULT: EiF4E3 was the most likely potential targeting protein of microRNA-338. The secondary structure of local region of eiF4E3 recognizing microRNA-338 was conservative. The ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase activity in the experimental group was much higher than that of control group. However, there was no significant difference in the expression of eiF4E3 between these two groups.&#9;CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-338 can recognize the 3'UTR of eiF4E3 while it has no significant effect on the expression of eiF4E3. The post-target-recognizing regulation for miRNA do exist and this mechanism is possibly related to the tertiary structure of target mRNA.&#9;&#9;&#9;21170291&#9;MicroRNA-21 dysregulates the expression of MEF2C in neurons in monkey and human SIV/HIV neurological disease.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating a plethora of physiological and pathophysiogical processes including neurodegeneration. In both HIV associated dementia in humans and its monkey model SIV encephalitis we find miR-21, a miRNA largely known for its link to oncogenesis, to be significantly upregulated in the brain. In situ hybridization of the diseased brain sections revealed induction of miR-21 in neurons. MiR-21 can be induced in neurons by prolonged N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor stimulation, an excitotoxic process active in HIV and other neurodegenerative diseases. Introduction of miR-21 into human neurons leads to pathological functional defects. Furthermore, we show that miR-21 specifically targets the mRNA of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), a transcription factor crucial for neuronal function, and reduces its expression. MEF2C is dramatically downregulated in neurons of HIV-associated dementia patients as well as monkeys with SIVE. Together, this study elucidates a novel role for miR-21 in the brain, not only as a potential signature of neurological disease but also as a crucial effector of HIV induced neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.&#9;&#9;&#9;21205279&#9;New insights into the roles of microRNAs in drug addiction and neuroplasticity.&#9;&#9;ABSTRACT : Drug addiction is a major public health issue. It is typically a multigenetic brain disorder, implying combined changes of expression of several hundred genes. Psychostimulants (such as cocaine, heroin and amphetamines) induce strong and persistent neuroadaptive changes through a surfeit of gene regulatory mechanisms leading to addiction. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, known as the 'reward pathway', plays a crucial role in the development of drug dependence. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, particularly abundant in the nervous system, that play key roles as regulatory molecules in processes such as neurogenesis, synapse development and plasticity in the brain. They also act as key spatiotemporal regulators during dendritic morphogenesis, controlling the expression of hundreds of genes involved in neuroplasticity and in the function of synapses. Recent studies have identified changes of several specific miRNA expression profiles and polymorphisms affecting the interactions between miRNAs and their targets in various brain disorders, including addiction: miR-16 causes adaptive changes in production of the serotonin transporter; miR-133b is specifically expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and regulates the production of tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter; miR-212 affects production of striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synaptic plasticity upon cocaine. Clearly, specific miRNAs have emerged as key regulators leading to addiction, and could serve as valuable targets for more efficient therapies. In this review, the aim is to provide an overview of the emerging role of miRNAs in addiction.&#9;&#9;&#9;21209202&#9;Phosphodiesterase-4D knock-out and RNA interference-mediated knock-down enhance memory and increase hippocampal neurogenesis via increased cAMP signaling.&#9;&#9;Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) plays an important role in mediating memory via the control of intracellular cAMP signaling; inhibition of PDE4 enhances memory. However, development of PDE4 inhibitors as memory enhancers has been hampered by their major side effect of emesis. PDE4 has four subtypes (PDE4A-D) consisting of 25 splice variants. Mice deficient in PDE4D displayed memory enhancement in radial arm maze, water maze, and object recognition tests. These effects were mimicked by repeated treatment with rolipram in wild-type mice. In addition, similarly as rolipram-treated wild-type mice, PDE4D-deficient mice also displayed increased hippocampal neurogenesis and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB). Furthermore, microinfusion of lentiviral vectors that contained microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting long-form PDE4D isoforms into bilateral dentate gyri of the mouse hippocampus downregulated PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, enhanced memory, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis and pCREB. Finally, while rolipram and PDE4D deficiency shortened α2 adrenergic receptor-mediated anesthesia, a surrogate measure of emesis, miRNA-mediated PDE4D knock-down in the hippocampus did not. The present results suggest that PDE4D, in particular long-form PDE4D, plays a critical role in the mediation of memory and hippocampal neurogenesis, which are mediated by cAMP/CREB signaling; reduced expression of PDE4D, or at least PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, in the hippocampus enhances memory but appears not to cause emesis. These novel findings will aid in the development of PDE4 subtype- or variant-selective inhibitors for treatment of disorders involving impaired cognition, including Alzheimer's disease.&#9;&#9;&#9;21295623&#9;Identification of blood microRNAs associated to Parkinsońs disease.&#9;&#9;The present study demonstrates that blood samples can be used as a source of miRNA identification associated to Parkinson's disease (PD). A set of six differentially expressed microRNAs were identified. They form two groups according to their expression profile in control, non-treated, early-onset and treated Parkinson's disease subjects. While miR-1, miR-22* and miR-29 expression levels allowed to distinguish non-treated PD from healthy subjects, miR-16-2*, miR-26a2* and miR30a differentiated treated from untreated patients. This study is innovative in contributing to the development of effective PD biomarkers.&#9;&#9;&#9;21302725&#9;Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension: clinical and demographic features.&#9;&#9;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical condition characterized by elevated intracranial pressure and absence of clinical, laboratory or radiographic evidence of central nervous system infection, vascular malformation, intracranial space occupying lesion or hydrocephalus. In the last years the raising understanding of pediatric IIH, especially concerning its demographics and epidemiology, has brought up to a redefinition of diagnostic criteria and reevaluation of pathogenesis and treatment. The authors reviewed the records of nineteen consecutive children with newly diagnosed IIH in order to compare demographic characteristics, clinical pictures and ophthalmologic aspects as optic disc evaluation and visual field evaluation, as well as treatment modalities and follow up. Beside obesity and female gender, potential alternative risk factors remains to be investigated, which need a good collaboration between neuro-ophthalmologists and pediatric neurologists.&#9;&#9;&#9;21338582&#9;A microRNA embedded AAV alpha-synuclein gene silencing vector for dopaminergic neurons.&#9;&#9;Alpha-synuclein (SNCA), an abundantly expressed presynaptic protein, is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Since over-expression of human SNCA (hSNCA) leads to death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in human, rodent and fly brain, hSNCA gene silencing may reduce levels of toxic forms of SNCA and ameliorate degeneration of DA neurons in PD. To begin to develop a gene therapy for PD based on hSNCA gene silencing, two AAV gene silencing vectors were designed, and tested for efficiency and specificity of silencing, as well as toxicity in vitro. The same hSNCA silencing sequence (shRNA) was used in both vectors, but in one vector, the shRNA was embedded in a microRNA backbone and driven by a pol II promoter, and in the other the shRNA was not embedded in a microRNA and was driven by a pol III promoter. Both vectors silenced hSNCA to the same extent in 293T cells transfected with hSNCA. In DA PC12 cells, neither vector decreased expression of rat SNCA, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) or the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). However, the mir30 embedded vector was significantly less toxic to both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells. Our in vitro data suggest that this miRNA-embedded silencing vector may be ideal for chronic in vivo SNCA gene silencing in DA neurons.&#9;&#9;&#9;21342132&#9;Practical Aspects of microRNA Target Prediction.&#9;&#9;microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. These small regulatory molecules play a key role in the majority of biological processes and their expression is also tightly regulated. Both the deregulation of genes controlled by miRNAs and the altered miRNA expression have been linked to many disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases. However, interactions between miRNAs and their targets are complex and very often there are numerous putative miRNA recognition sites in mRNAs. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction algorithms are available, results of their application are often inconsistent. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task. In this review, currently available and frequently used computational tools for miRNA target prediction, i.e., PicTar, TargetScan, DIANA-microT, miRanda, rna22 and PITA are outlined and various practical aspects of miRNA target analysis are extensively discussed. Moreover, the performance of three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan and DIANA-microT) is both demonstrated and evaluated by performing an in-depth analysis of miRNA interactions with mRNAs derived from genes triggering hereditary neurological disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), such as Huntington's disease (HD), a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).&#9;&#9;&#9;21356210&#9;Angiostrongylus cantonensis: Identification and characterization of microRNAs in male and female adults.&#9;&#9;Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes eosinophilic meningitis and eosinophilic pleocytosis in humans and is of significant socio-economic importance globally. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in gene expression regulation, cellular function and defense, homeostasis and pathogenesis. They have been identified in a diverse range of organisms. The objective of this study was to determine and characterize miRNAs of female and male adults of A. cantonensis by Solexa deep sequencing. A total of 8861,260 and 10,957,957 high quality reads with 20 and 23 conserved miRNAs were obtained in females and males, respectively. No new miRNA sequence was found. Nucleotide bias analysis showed that uracil was the prominent nucleotide, particularly at positions of 1, 10, 14, 17 and 22, approximately at the beginning, middle and the end of the conserved miRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNA profiles in A. cantonensis, which may represent a new platform for studying regulation of genes and their networks in A. cantonensis.&#9;&#9;&#9;21358093&#9;Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway.&#9;&#9;AIM: Medulloblastoma is a malignant brain tumor that occurs predominantly in children. Current risk stratification based on clinical parameters is inadequate for accurate prognostication. MicroRNA expression is known to be deregulated in various cancers and has been found to be useful in predicting tumor behavior. In order to get a better understanding of medulloblastoma biology, miRNA profiling of medulloblastomas was carried out in parallel with expression profiling of protein-coding genes.&#9;MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA profiling of medulloblastomas was carried out using Taqman Low Density Array v 1.0 having 365 human microRNAs. In parallel, genome-wide expression profiling of protein-coding genes was carried out using Affymetrix gene 1.0 ST arrays.&#9;RESULTS: Both the profiling studies identified four molecular subtypes of medulloblastomas. Expression levels of select protein-coding genes and miRNAs could classify an independent set of medulloblastomas. Twelve of 31 medulloblastomas were found to overexpress genes belonging to the canonical WNT signaling pathway and carry a mutation in CTNNB1 gene. A number of miRNAs like miR-193a, miR-224/miR-452 cluster, miR-182/miR-183/miR-96 cluster, and miR-148a having potential tumor/metastasis suppressive activity were found to be overexpressed in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas. Exogenous expression of miR-193a and miR-224, two miRNAs that have the highest WNT pathway specific upregulation, was found to inhibit proliferation, increase radiation sensitivity and reduce anchorage-independent growth of medulloblastoma cells.&#9;CONCLUSION: Expression level of tumor/metastasis suppressive miRNAs in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas is likely to determine their response to treatment, and thus, these miRNAs would be important biomarkers for risk stratification within the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas.&#9;&#9;&#9;21376023&#9;Temporal lobe epilepsy induces differential expression of hippocampal miRNAs including let-7e and miR-23a/b.&#9;&#9;To understand the role of miRNAs in the molecular mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we investigated the changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of chronic TLE rat models. MiRNAs microarray analysis results showed that 125 miRNAs were detected in the hippocampus of lithium-pilocarpine-induced TLE rats and normal rats. Compared with normal rats (control group), 23 of the 125 miRNAs were expressed differentially in TLE rats including 5 down-regulated miRNAs (let-7e included) and 18 up-regulated miRNAs (miR-23a/b included). Furthermore, let-7e and miR-23a/b analysis in rat hippocampus were performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at 0h, 1h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 2days, 7days,10days, 30days,50days after induction of status epilepticus (SE). let-7e was detected down-regulated expression at 0h, 1h, 6h, 2days, 7days, 50days after SE and up-regulated expression at 12h, 24h, 10days, 30days after SE, which was significantly up-regulated expression at 24h after SE (10.49 folds, P&lt;0.01). miR-23a/b was detected down-regulated at 0h, 1h, 6h, 12h, 2days, 7days, 10days, 30days after SE and significantly up-regulated at 24h (4.49 folds P&lt;0.01), 50d (2.4 folds, P&lt;0.01) after SE. TLE alters the expression levels of a subset of miRNAs in the hippocampus and these deregulated miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy directly or indirectly. Also the temporal change of the let-7e and miR-23a/b expression in the epileptogenesis indicated their underlying functions on TLE.&#9;&#9;&#9;21408164&#9;Co-expression of host and viral microRNAs in porcine dendritic cells infected by the pseudorabies virus.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nt long that modulate gene expression in animals and plants. It has been recently demonstrated that herpesviruses encode miRNAs to control the post-transcriptional regulation of expression from their own genomes and possibly that of their host, thus adding an additional layer of complexity to the physiological cross-talk between host and pathogen. The present study focussed on the interactions between porcine dendritic cells (DCs) and the Pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alpha-herpesvirus causing Aujeszky's disease in pigs. A catalogue of porcine and viral miRNAs, expressed eight hours post-infection, was established by deep sequencing. An average of 2 million reads per sample with a size of 21-24 nucleotides was obtained from six libraries representing three biological replicates of infected and mock-infected DCs. Almost 95% of reads mapped to the draft pig genome sequence and pig miRNAs previously annotated in dedicated databases were detected by sequence alignment. In silico prediction allowed the identification of unknown porcine as well as of five miRNAs transcribed by the Large Latency Transcript (LLT) of PRV. The gene target prediction of the viral miRNAs and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed pig miRNAs were conducted to contextualize the identified small RNA molecules and functionally characterize their involvement in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The results support a role for PRV miRNAs in the maintenance of the host cell latency state through the down-regulation of immediate-early viral genes which is similar to other herpesviruses. The differentially expressed swine miRNAs identified a unique network of target genes with highly significant functions in the development and function of the nervous system and in infectious mechanisms, suggesting that the modulation of both host and viral miRNAs is necessary for the establishment of PRV latency.&#9;&#9;&#9;21422175&#9;Differential MicroRNA Expression in Experimental Cerebral and Noncerebral Malaria.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulatory molecules that have been implicated in the regulation of immune responses, but their role in the immune response to Plasmodium infection is unknown. We studied the expression of selected miRNAs following infection of CBA mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA), which causes cerebral malaria (CM), or Plasmodium berghei K173 (PbK), which causes severe malaria but without cerebral complications, termed non-CM. The differential expression profiles of selected miRNAs (let-7i, miR-27a, miR-150, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-155) were analyzed in mouse brain and heart tissue by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). We identified three miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the brain of PbA-infected CBA mice: let7i, miR-27a, and miR-150. In contrast, no miRNA changes were detected in the heart, an organ with no known pathology during acute malaria. To investigate the involvement of let-7i, miR-27a, and miR-150 in CM-resistant mice, we assessed the expression levels in gamma interferon knockout (IFN-γ(-/-)) mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background. The expression of let-7i, miR-27a, and miR-150 was unchanged in both wild-type (WT) and IFN-γ(-/-) mice following infection. Overexpression of these three miRNAs during PbA, but not PbK, infection in WT mice may be critical for the triggering of the neurological syndrome via regulation of their potential downstream targets. Our data suggest that in the CBA mouse at least, miRNA may have a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.&#9;&#9;&#9;21445348&#9;Increased incidence of choroid plexus carcinoma due to the germline TP53 R337H mutation in southern Brazil.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are rare tumors predominantly found in children. Given the high frequency of the germline R337H mutation in the TP53 gene in southern Brazil, we have evaluated the frequency of the R337H mutation in families with CPC in children.&#9;METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present series included 29 patients that were admitted to the same institution from 1992 to 2010, including 22 children with CPC (0.08-13.6 years of age at diagnosis) and 7 children with papilloma of the choroid plexus (Pp; 0.5-9.8 years of age). Surgical resection was possible in 28 children. Blood and/or tumor DNA was extracted and analyzed using PCR-RFLP and results were confirmed by sequencing 240 bp of the TP53 exon 10. The patients, all parents, and some relatives submitted samples for blood DNA analysis. In addition, we have also examined the presence of the mutation in DNA from paraffin-embedded tumor samples to evaluate loss of heterozygosity. We found 63.3% (14/22) of the CPC patients positive for the germline R337H mutation; CPC samples were either heterozygous (n = 7), lost only the wild-type (n = 4), or only the R337H copy (n = 2). One CPC sample was not available. All Pp cases (7/7, 100%) were negative for R337H. Cure (&gt;5 years survival free of disease) was observed in 18.1% of the CPC cases with the R337H mutation (2/11), 71.4% of the Pp (5/7), and 25% of CPC cases negative for the R337H mutation (2/8). Family history of cancer (with 2 or more cancer cases) was exclusively identified on the parental side segregating the R337H mutation, and 50% (7/14) of them were compatible with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome.&#9;SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show for the first time that the R337H TP53 mutation is responsible for 63% of the CPC cases in children, suggesting a higher incidence of CPC in southern Brazil.&#9;&#9;&#9;21447094&#9;MicroRNA miR-133b is essential for functional recovery after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles during development and also in adult organisms by regulating the expression of multiple target genes. Here, we studied the function of miR-133b during zebrafish spinal cord regeneration and show upregulation of miR-133b expression in regenerating neurons of the brainstem after transection of the spinal cord. miR-133b has been shown to promote tissue regeneration in other tissue, but its ability to do so in the nervous system has yet to be tested. Inhibition of miR-133b expression by antisense morpholino (MO) application resulted in impaired locomotor recovery and reduced regeneration of axons from neurons in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, superior reticular formation and intermediate reticular formation. miR-133b targets the small GTPase RhoA, which is an inhibitor of axonal growth, as well as other neurite outgrowth-related molecules. Our results indicate that miR-133b is an important determinant in spinal cord regeneration of adult zebrafish through reduction in RhoA protein levels by direct interaction with its mRNA. While RhoA has been studied as a therapeutic target in spinal cord injury, this is the first demonstration of endogenous regulation of RhoA by a microRNA that is required for spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish. The ability of miR-133b to suppress molecules that inhibit axon regrowth may underlie the capacity for adult zebrafish to recover locomotor function after spinal cord injury.&#9;&#9;&#9;21449035&#9;Knockdown of GAD67 protein levels normalizes neuronal activity in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.&#9;&#9;BACKGROUND: Dopamine depletion of the striatum is one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. The loss of dopamine upregulates GAD67 expression in the striatal projection neurons and causes other changes in the activity of the basal ganglia circuit.&#9;METHODS: To normalize the GAD67 expression in the striatum after dopamine depletion, we developed several lentiviral vectors that express RNA interference (RNAi) directed against GAD67 mitochondrial RNA. The vectors were injected into the striatum of hemiparkinsonian rats and the level of GAD67 protein as well as a marker of neuronal activity, mtCO1, was analyzed using western blots.&#9;RESULTS: Unilateral lesions of the dopamine neurons in substantia nigra resulted in an increased level of GAD67 protein in the ipsilateral striatum. Furthermore, we detected significantly higher levels of mtCO1, after dopamine depletion in the striatum. Using a lentiviral vectors with a synthetic miRNA scaffold to deliver RNAi, we were able to normalize the GAD67 protein levels in the parkinsonian rat striatum. In addition, we were able to normalize the increased neural activity, which resulted from the loss of dopamine as measured by the marker mtCO1.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RNAi directed against GAD67 may be a valid approach to correct the dysregulation of the basal ganglia circuit in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. The possibility to correct for a loss of dopamine using nondopamimetic tools is interesting because it may be more directed towards the casual mechanisms of the motor symptoms.

However, to date, most computational and algorithmic efforts have been directed at mining data from each of these molecular levels (genomic, transcriptional, etc.) separately. In view of the rapid advances in technology (new generation sequencing, high-throughput proteomics) it is important to address the problem of analyzing these data as a whole, i.e. preserving the emergent properties that appear in the cellular system when all molecular levels are interacting. We analyzed one of the (currently) few datasets that provide both transcriptional and post-transcriptional data of the same samples to investigate the possibility to extract more information, using a joint analysis approach.&#9;RESULTS: We use Factor Analysis coupled with pre-established knowledge as a theoretical base to achieve this goal. Our intention is to identify structures that contain information from both mRNAs and miRNAs, and that can explain the complexity of the data. Despite the small sample available, we can show that this approach permits identification of meaningful structures, in particular two polycistronic miRNA genes related to transcriptional activity and likely to be relevant in the discrimination between gliosarcomas and other brain tumors.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: This suggests the need to develop methodologies to simultaneously mine information from different levels of biological organization, rather than linking separate analyses performed in parallel.&#9;&#9;&#9;21483847&#9;A Ten-microRNA Expression Signature Predicts Survival in Glioblastoma.&#9;&#9;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with very poor patient median survival. To identify a microRNA (miRNA) expression signature that can predict GBM patient survival, we analyzed the miRNA expression data of GBM patients (n = 222) derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We divided the patients randomly into training and testing sets with equal number in each group. We identified 10 significant miRNAs using Cox regression analysis on the training set and formulated a risk score based on the expression signature of these miRNAs that segregated the patients into high and low risk groups with significantly different survival times (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.4-3.8; p&lt;0.0001). Of these 10 miRNAs, 7 were found to be risky miRNAs and 3 were found to be protective. This signature was independently validated in the testing set (HR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1-2.8; p = 0.002). GBM patients with high risk scores had overall poor survival compared to the patients with low risk scores. Overall survival among the entire patient set was 35.0% at 2 years, 21.5% at 3 years, 18.5% at 4 years and 11.8% at 5 years in the low risk group, versus 11.0%, 5.5%, 0.0 and 0.0% respectively in the high risk group (HR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4-2.8; p&lt;0.0001). Cox multivariate analysis with patient age as a covariate on the entire patient set identified risk score based on the 10 miRNA expression signature to be an independent predictor of patient survival (HR = 1.120; 95% CI = 1.04-1.20; p = 0.003). Thus we have identified a miRNA expression signature that can predict GBM patient survival. These findings may have implications in the understanding of gliomagenesis, development of targeted therapy and selection of high risk cancer patients for adjuvant therapy.&#9;&#9;&#9;21487258&#9;Route Learning Performance: Is it a Hippocampus Function?&#9;&#9;INTRODUCTION: In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), about 30% of the patients do not achieve adequate pharmacologic control of refractory crises, and surgery becomes an alternative. In ablative interventions, neuropsychologic testing of memory is a crucial step. However, evaluations of the right hippocampal functions have not been consistent.&#9;AIM: To assess the hippocampal function in remote orientation and visuospatial memory in patients with refractory temporal epilepsy.&#9;METHODS: A controlled study of patients with left (LTLE) or right (RTLE) TLE. The subjects were submitted to a neuropsychologic evaluation through the Route Learning Test and the Childhood Home Test in the preoperative period. The statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis, analysis of variance, χ, and Mann-Whitney U tests.&#9;RESULTS: There was no significant difference in performance in the remote visuospatial memory (as measured by the Childhood Home Test) across the groups (LTLE, RTLE, and control). Concerning the spatial orientation memory, however, there was a significant difference between the LTLE and controls as compared with the RTLE group (P&lt;0.001), the latter showing a poorer performance.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that spatial orientation memory relies on the integrity of the right hippocampus. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.&#9;&#9;&#9;21522051&#9;Ethnoracial differences in the clinical characteristics of Alzheimer's disease at initial presentation at an urban Alzheimer's disease center.&#9;&#9;OBJECTIVE: : To compare presentation of Alzheimer disease (AD) at the time of initial evaluation at a university specialty clinic across three ethnoracial groups in order to understand similarities and differences in the demographic, clinical, cognitive, psychiatric, and biologic features.&#9;DESIGN: : Cross-sectional study.&#9;PARTICIPANTS: : A total of 1,341 self-identified African American, Latino (primarily of Caribbean origin), and white non-Hispanic (&quot;WNH&quot;) subjects were recruited from primary care sites or by referral by primary care physicians.&#9;MEASUREMENTS: : Demographic variables and age of onset of AD, as well as cognitive, functional, and mood impairments at the time of initial presentation and frequencies of apolipoprotein E genotypes, were compared across groups.&#9;RESULTS: : Differences among ethnoracial groups were found for nearly all variables of interest. In particular, the largely immigrant Puerto Rican Latino group had an earlier age of onset of AD, more cognitive impairment, and greater severity of cognitive impairment at the time of initial evaluation in the setting of low average education and socioeconomic status. There was more depression in the Latinos compared with African Americans and WNHs. Greater severity of symptoms was not accounted for by a difference in lag time between onset of symptoms and initial evaluation. The apolipoprotein E-4 genotype was not associated with AD in the Latino cohort.&#9;CONCLUSIONS: : Minority groups in Philadelphia, especially Latinos, exhibit a more severe profile of AD at the time of presentation than WNHs. Important potential confounds need to be considered and future research comparing immigrant and nonimmigrant Latino groups will be necessary to elucidate the highly significant differences reported.&#9;&#9;&#9;21537368&#9;MicroRNA: A matter of life or death.&#9;&#9;Progressive cell loss due to apoptosis is a pathological hallmark implicated in a wide spectrum of degenerative diseases such as heart disease, atherosclerotic arteries and hypertensive vessels, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in apoptosistic cell death. Once ignored completely or overlooked as cellular detritus, microRNAs (miRNAs) that were discovered only a decade ago, have recently taken many by surprise. The importance of miRNAs has steadily gained appreciation and miRNA biology has exploded into a massive swell of interest with enormous range and potential in almost every biological discipline because of their widespread expression and diverse functions in both animals and humans. It has been established that miRNAs are critical regulators of apoptosis of various cell types. These small molecules act by repressing the expression of either the proapoptotic or antiapoptotic genes to produce antiapoptotic or proapoptotic effects. Appealing evidence has been accumulating for the involvement of miRNAs in human diseases associated with apoptotic cell death and the potential of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of the diseases. This editorial aims to convey this message and to boost up the research interest by providing a timely, comprehensive overview on regulation of apoptosis by miRNAs and a synopsis on the pathophysiologic implications of this novel regulatory network based on the currently available data in the literature. It begins with a brief introduction to apoptosis and miRNAs, followed by the description of the fundamental aspects of miRNA biogenesis and action, and the role of miRNAs in regulating apoptosis of cancer cells and cardiovascular cells. Speculations on the development of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets are also presented. Remarks are also provided to point out the unanswered questions and to outline the new directions for the future research of the field.&#9;&#9;&#9;21551949&#9;Plasma miR-124 as a biomarker for cerebral infarction.&#9;&#9;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that play an important role in various physiological processes by downregulating target genes. Recently, plasma miRNAs have been investigated as biomarkers for various diseases. In this study, miRNA array analysis in various tissues showed that miR-124 is almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous system and neuronal cells, suggesting that it might be useful as a potential biomarker for neurological diseases. We examined whether plasma concentrations of brain-specific miRNA can serve as a biomarker for cerebral infarction, where the cerebral infarction was modeled by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat. Plasma concentrations of miR-124 were significantly elevated at 6 h, and remained elevated at 48 h after MCAO introduction. Thus, plasma concentration of miR-124 provides a promising candidate biomarker for early detection of cerebral infarction.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;"/>
